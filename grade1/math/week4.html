            <h2>Week 4 Overview</h2>
            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will identify four basic 2D shapes and compare lengths of objects using non-standard units like paper clips or blocks.</p>
            <p>This week introduces geometry and measurement. Students will learn to recognize and describe circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles by their attributes. They'll also discover how to measure length by using everyday objects as units. By Friday, students will identify shapes in their environment and measure objects using non-standard units confidently.</p>

                    <p>Hold up a plate and a square sticky note. Say: "Today we're going to learn about shapes! Shapes are all around us. This plate is a special shape called a circle. This sticky note is called a square."</p>

                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Exploring Circles:</strong></p>
                    <p>Hold up a circular object. Say: "This is a circle. Let's see what makes it a circle." Trace your finger around the edge: "A circle is perfectly round. It goes around and around with no corners or straight lines."</p>
                    <p>Let your student trace around the circle with their finger. Show several circular objects: coin, lid, ball. Say: "These are all circles because they're round with no corners."</p>
                    <p>Have your student draw a circle in the air with their finger. Then draw circles on paper.</p>
                    <p><strong>Exploring Squares:</strong></p>
                    <p>Hold up a square object. Say: "This is a square. A square has 4 sides." Point to each side and count: "1, 2, 3, 4 sides. All 4 sides are the same length—they're equal."</p>
                    <p>Point to the corners: "A square also has 4 corners. Count with me: 1, 2, 3, 4 corners." Let your student touch each corner as you count.</p>
                    <p>Show several square objects. Each time, count the 4 equal sides and 4 corners together.</p>
                    <p>Have your student draw squares on paper. Help them make 4 equal sides and 4 corners.</p>

                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Hold up two objects of different lengths (e.g., a long pencil and a short crayon). Ask: "Which one is longer?" Let them point.</p>
                    <p>Say: "Today we're going to learn to measure—to find out exactly HOW MUCH longer one thing is than another!"</p>

                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Introducing Measuring with Units:</strong></p>
                    <p>Place a pencil on the table. Say: "Let's find out how long this pencil is using paper clips." Line up paper clips end-to-end along the pencil's length.</p>
                    <p>Count together: "1, 2, 3, 4, 5 paper clips. This pencil is 5 paper clips long!"</p>
                    <p>Important points to teach:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No gaps between paper clips</li>
                        <li>No overlapping</li>
                        <li>Line them up straight</li>
                        <li>Start at one end and go to the other end</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Measure a book together using paper clips. Count and record: "The book is ___ paper clips long."</p>
                    <p>Now measure the same book using blocks. Count: "The book is ___ blocks long."</p>
                    <p>Say: "Notice we got a different number! That's because blocks and paper clips are different sizes. The unit we use matters!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Give your student paper clips and objects to measure:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Measure this spoon with paper clips." (Student lines up and counts)</li>
                        <li>"Measure your shoe with paper clips." (Student measures)</li>
                        <li>"Measure this crayon with paper clips." (Student measures)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Record each measurement: "The spoon is 6 paper clips long."</p>
                    <p>Compare: "Which is longer—the spoon or the crayon? How do you know?" (The spoon is 6 paper clips, the crayon is 3 paper clips, so the spoon is longer.)</p>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask: "What does it mean to measure?" (To find out how long something is.) "Why do we need to line up our units with no gaps?" (So we measure accurately.)</p>
