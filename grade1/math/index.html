            <h2>Mathematics Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In the first month of Grade 1 mathematics, students build foundational number sense through
                concrete, hands-on activities. Using everyday objects they can touch and count, students
                develop an understanding of numbers 1-20, basic addition and subtraction concepts, and simple
                shapes and measurement. Each lesson emphasizes that math is about discovering exact, reliable
                relationships in reality—not guessing or memorizing without understanding. Students learn to
                trust their ability to reason through problems step-by-step, building confidence as independent
                mathematical thinkers.

            <h2>Weekly Lesson Plans</h2>
            <p>Each week contains 5 daily lessons (Monday-Friday), each designed for 15-20 minutes of focused instruction.</p>

            <div class="progression-overview">
                <!-- Week 1 -->
                <div class="week-card">
                    <h3>Week 1: Counting to 10 with Objects</h3>
                    <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will count from 1 to 10 accurately using physical objects and understand one-to-one correspondence.</p>
                    <p class="week-summary">Students begin with concrete counting using household items. Each day focuses on counting practice with different materials, building accuracy and confidence in the number sequence 1-10.</p>

                    <h3>Week 2: Introduction to Addition Within 10</h3>
                    <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will understand addition as combining two groups of objects and create simple addition sentences (e.g., 3 + 2 = 5).</p>
                    <p class="week-summary">Building on counting skills, students learn that addition means "putting together" or "combining." They use manipulatives to physically combine groups and write the corresponding number sentences.</p>

                    <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will understand subtraction as taking away from a group and create simple subtraction sentences (e.g., 7 - 3 = 4).</p>
                    <p class="week-summary">Students discover subtraction by physically removing objects from a group. They learn to write subtraction sentences and see how subtraction is the opposite action of addition.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started: Orientation for New Homeschool Teachers</h2>
            <p>If this is your first time teaching Mathematics at home, here's how to prepare:</p>

            <div class="orientation-steps">
                <h3>Before You Begin</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Review the full week:</strong> Read through all 5 daily lessons before Monday to gather materials and familiarize yourself with the progression.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gather materials:</strong> Check the materials list for Week 1, Day 1. Most items are household objects—see substitutions if you don't have specific items.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan your schedule:</strong> Each lesson takes 15-20 minutes. Choose a consistent time each day when your student is alert and focused.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare your space:</strong> Clear a table or floor space where your student can spread out counting objects. Have a small basket or container to hold manipulatives (blocks, beans, coins, etc.).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>During Each Lesson</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start with the objective:</strong> Tell your student what they'll learn today in simple language.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow the 4-part structure:</strong> Introduction → Main Activity → Practice → Closure. Timing suggestions are flexible—adjust to your student's pace.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the assessment questions:</strong> These quick checks help you know if your student understood before moving forward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it positive:</strong> Focus on what your student CAN do. Learning happens through practice and encouragement.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Supplemental Resources (Optional)</h3>
                <p>Many lessons include optional YouTube videos, library book suggestions, and Midjourney image prompts. These are enhancements, not requirements. Use them if they fit your family's schedule and resources.</p>
