            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will count from 1 to 10 accurately using physical objects and understand one-to-one correspondence.</p>
            <p>This week introduces counting as a way to find out exactly how many objects are in a group. Students will practice counting with different materials each day, learning that each number word matches one object (one-to-one correspondence) and that the last number counted tells the total quantity. By Friday, students will count confidently and accurately to 10 using any collection of objects.</p>

                <h3>Learning Objective</h3>

                <h3>Materials Needed</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>10 small objects that are identical or very similar (blocks, beans, coins, or small toys)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blocks</strong> → beans, coins, pasta pieces, buttons, small toys, or any small household items</li>
                    <li><strong>Basket</strong> → bowl, box, or any container</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="lesson-procedure">
                <h3>Procedure</h3>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Show your student a basket containing 10 colorful objects (blocks, crayons, small toys). Hold up the basket and ask: "How many do you think we have in here?" Allow your student to guess. Accept any answer positively: "That's a good guess! Let's find out the exact number by counting."</p>
                    <p>Say: "Today we're going to learn to count objects from 1 to 10. Counting helps us find out exactly how many things we have—not just a guess, but the real, exact amount."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: Teacher Models Counting (3 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Take the objects out of the basket and spread them in a line on the table or floor. Say: "Watch how I count. I'm going to touch each block and say one number." Point to each object, one at a time, counting aloud: "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10." Move each object slightly as you count it, or push it to the side.</p>
                    <p>Emphasize: "I touched each block ONE time. Each block gets ONE number. That's called one-to-one correspondence—one object, one number word."</p>
                    <p>Point to the last object: "The last number I said was 10. That means there are 10 blocks total."</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Count Together (3 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Put the objects back in a line. Say: "Now let's count together. Point to each block with me." Count slowly with your student, both of you pointing: "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10."</p>
                    <p>Repeat this 2-3 times. Each time, change the arrangement slightly (line, circle, scattered) to show that arrangement doesn't matter—the count stays the same.</p>
                    <p>Say: "Did you notice? No matter how we arrange the blocks, we still have 10! Counting tells us the exact amount."</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 3: Student Counts Independently (2-3 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Say: "Now it's your turn to count all by yourself. I'll watch." Observe as your student counts the 10 objects. If they skip a number or count an object twice, gently stop and say: "Let's slow down and make sure we touch each one just once. Let's try again together."</p>
                    <p>Once successful, celebrate: "You did it! You counted to 10 all by yourself!"</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 4: Mix It Up (1-2 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Rearrange the objects in a different pattern (circle, two rows, random pile). Ask: "I moved the blocks around. Do we still have 10?" Let your student count again to discover that yes, it's still 10.</p>
                    <p>Explain: "The order and arrangement don't change how many we have. Counting always gives us the same true answer: 10 blocks."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Give your student a new set of 10 different objects (if available—coins, toys, crayons) or use the same blocks. Say: "Can you count these and tell me how many there are?" Observe as they count independently.</p>
                    <p>Provide 2-3 different counting opportunities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Count blocks lined up in a row</li>
                        <li>Count blocks scattered on the table</li>
                        <li>Count blocks in a pile (touching each as they count)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If your student is successful, try giving them 7 or 8 objects and ask them to count. This shows they can count accurately to any number within 10, not just exactly 10.</p>
                    <p>Give gentle correction if needed: "I saw you counted that one twice. Let's move each block aside as we count it, so we know which ones we've already counted."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask: "What did we learn to do today?" (Count to 10!) "Why is counting helpful?" (It tells us exactly how many, not just a guess.)</p>
                    <p>Celebrate their success: "You learned to count to 10 today! That's a very important skill. Tomorrow, we'll practice counting lots of different things around our house."</p>
                    <p>Give a high-five or positive affirmation: "I'm proud of how carefully you counted each object. You used your mind to figure out the exact number!"</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <ul>
                    <li>Does the student correctly count all 10 objects without skipping numbers or objects? - Expected: Points to each object once and counts "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10" in order</li>
                    <li>Ask: "How many blocks do we have?" after they finish counting - Expected: "Ten" or "10" (recognizing that the last number counted is the total)</li>
                    <li>Can the student count a new set of objects (different from practice) independently without teacher help? - Expected: Successfully counts 7-10 objects without assistance</li>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Counting Hunt:</strong> Go around your home together and collect 10 of one type of object. For example, gather 10 spoons from the kitchen. Count them together: "1, 2, 3...10."</p>
                    <p>Then find a different type of object. Collect 10 crayons. Count together again.</p>
                    <p>Repeat with 3-4 different object types: books, shoes, toys, etc.</p>
                    <p>Each time, emphasize: "It doesn't matter what we count—blocks, spoons, or crayons—counting always works the same way. One-to-one correspondence: one object, one number."</p>

                    <p>Show a card with the numeral "5" written on it. Say: "This is the symbol for five. When we see this, it means we have 5 of something." Place 5 objects below the card.</p>

                    <p>Now add cards 6-10 and repeat the activity. Let your student place the objects for each numeral with your guidance.</p>

                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Mix up the numeral cards. Show a card (e.g., "7") and say: "Show me this many objects." Let your student count out 7 objects.</p>
                    <p>Repeat with different numerals: 3, 9, 5, 10, 2, etc. Give positive feedback for correct matches.</p>
                    <p>Reverse activity: Place a group of objects (e.g., 6 blocks) and ask: "Which numeral card matches this group?" Let your student find the "6" card.</p>

                <p>This week, your student learned to count from 1 to 10 using physical objects and understand one-to-one correspondence. They discovered that counting works for any type of object and that arrangement doesn't change the count. They can now match written numerals to quantities. Next week, we'll build on this foundation by introducing addition—combining groups to make bigger numbers!</p>
