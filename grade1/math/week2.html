            <h2>Week 2 Overview</h2>
            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will understand addition as combining two groups of objects and create simple addition sentences (e.g., 3 + 2 = 5).</p>
            <p>This week introduces addition as "putting together" or "combining" groups. Building on last week's counting skills, students will learn that when we join two groups, we can count them all together to find the total. By Friday, students will write simple addition sentences using the + and = symbols and solve addition problems within 10.</p>

                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Place 3 blocks in one container and 2 blocks in another container. Show your student both groups. Say: "I have 3 blocks here and 2 blocks here. What happens if I put them all together?" Pour both groups into one pile.</p>
                    <p>Say: "Today we're going to learn about combining groups—putting two groups together to find out how many we have in total. This is called addition!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Start with simple combinations. Place 2 blocks in one bowl and 3 blocks in another bowl.</p>
                    <p>Say: "Let's count the first group together: 1, 2. Now let's count the second group: 1, 2, 3. Now watch what happens when we combine them." Pour both groups together.</p>
                    <p>"Now let's count them ALL together: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. When we combined 2 and 3, we got 5 total!"</p>
                    <p>Repeat with different combinations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 blocks + 1 block = 5 blocks total</li>
                        <li>3 blocks + 3 blocks = 6 blocks total</li>
                        <li>5 blocks + 2 blocks = 7 blocks total</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each time, count each group separately, then combine and count the total together.</p>
                    <p>Emphasize: "When we put groups together, we're adding. The word 'add' means to combine or join."</p>

                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Give your student two containers and a pile of objects. Say: "Put 4 blocks in this bowl and 3 blocks in that bowl." Help them count as they place objects.</p>
                    <p>Then say: "Now combine them together and count to find the total." Let your student pour them together and count: "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7."</p>
                    <p>Repeat with different numbers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make a group of 2 and a group of 5, combine and count</li>

                        <li>Make a group of 3 and a group of 4, combine and count</li>
