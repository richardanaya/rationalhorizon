            <h2>Week 3 Overview</h2>
            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will understand subtraction as taking away from a group and create simple subtraction sentences (e.g., 7 - 3 = 4).</p>
            <p>This week introduces subtraction as "taking away" or "removing" from a group. Students will learn that subtraction is the opposite action of addition—instead of combining, we're separating. By Friday, students will write simple subtraction sentences using the minus (-) and equals (=) symbols and solve subtraction problems within 10.</p>

                    <p>Place 5 blocks on the table. Say: "I have 5 blocks. Watch what happens when I take away 2 blocks." Remove 2 blocks and set them aside. "How many blocks are left?" Count together: "1, 2, 3. There are 3 blocks left."</p>
                    <p>Say: "Today we're going to learn about taking away, which is called subtraction. Subtraction is the opposite of addition—instead of putting together, we're taking apart or removing."</p>

                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Start with simple examples. Place 6 blocks in front of your student.</p>
                    <p>Say: "Let's count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We have 6 blocks. Now let's take away 2 blocks." Remove 2 blocks and move them far away or put them back in the container.</p>
                    <p>"How many blocks are left? Let's count: 1, 2, 3, 4. When we take 2 away from 6, we have 4 left."</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Each time, emphasize: "We start with [number], take away [number], and [number] are left. When we take away, we end up with less than we started with."</p>

                    <p>Then say: "Now take away 4 and tell me how many are left." Watch as they remove 4 objects and count the remaining 5.</p>

                    <ul>

                    <p>Say: "This means: 8 minus 3. The minus sign tells us to take 3 away from the 8." Remove 3 blocks from the group of 8. Count what's left: "5 blocks are left. 8 minus 3 equals 5."</p>

They learned the minus (-) symbol, wrote subtraction sentences, and solved word problems. They can now subtract within 10 confidently! Next week, we'll explore shapes and measurement—learning about circles, squares, triangles, rectangles, and how to measure lengths using everyday objects.</p>
