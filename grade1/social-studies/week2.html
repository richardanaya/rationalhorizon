                    <p>Show your student a picture of a police officer. Ask: "Do you know who this is? Have you ever seen a police officer before?"</p>
                    <p>Say: "This is a police officer. Police officers are community helpers who have an important job—they keep people safe and help when there are emergencies. They chose this career because they want to protect others."</p>
                    <p>Explain: "Police officers wear special uniforms—usually dark blue—and they have a badge that shows they are police officers. They also wear a belt with tools like a radio to call for help."</p>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: Learn About Police Officers (4-5 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Explain what police officers do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Police officers make sure everyone follows the laws. Laws are rules that help people live safely together."</li>
                        <li>"They drive patrol cars around the neighborhood to watch for problems and help people who need assistance."</li>
                        <li>"If someone is in danger or there's an emergency, people call 911 and police officers come quickly to help."</li>
                        <li>"Police officers direct traffic to keep cars and people safe on the roads."</li>
                        <li>"They also visit schools to teach children about safety—like wearing seatbelts and not talking to strangers."</li>
                        <li>"Being a police officer takes courage and dedication. They train hard to learn how to help people in many different situations."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Ask: "Why is it important to have police officers in our community?" (They keep us safe, help in emergencies, make sure everyone follows the rules.)</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Draw a Police Officer (4-5 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Give your student paper and drawing materials. Say: "Let's draw a police officer!"</p>
                    <p>Guide them to draw:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A person in a blue uniform</li>
                        <li>A police hat (with a badge on the front)</li>
                        <li>A badge on the chest</li>
                        <li>Optional: a police car in the background</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As they draw, reinforce: "Police officers use their skills and training to help people every day. They chose a career that makes their community safer and better."</p>

                    <h4>Practice (3-4 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask review questions:</p>

                        <li>"What do police officers do?" (Keep people safe, enforce laws, help in emergencies.)</li>

                        <li>"What number do you call if you need a police officer in an emergency?" (911.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Discuss: "Police officers are regular people who decided to help others by becoming police officers. They work hard and use their minds to solve problems and keep everyone safe."</p>

                    <p>Explain: "Teachers are community helpers who help students learn new things. They work in schools, libraries, community centers, and even in people's homes (like homeschool teachers). Teachers care about helping children grow smarter and more capable."</p>

                        <li>"They assess students' progress to see what they've learned and what they need to practice more."</li>
                        <li>"Teachers create a safe and positive learning environment where students feel comfortable asking questions."</li>
                        <li>"Being a teacher requires patience, knowledge, and a love of learning. Teachers study hard in college to learn how to teach effectively."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Ask: "Why are teachers important?" (They help us learn, teach us new skills, encourage us.)</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Thank a Teacher (4-5 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Say: "Let's create a thank-you card for a teacher you know—it could be for me, or for another teacher in your life!"</p>
                    <p>Give your student paper and drawing materials. Help them:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Draw a picture of a teacher (at a desk, in front of a chalkboard, reading a book)</li>

                        <li>Add a message like: "Thank you for helping me learn!" or "You are a great teacher!"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"Mail carriers pick up mail from the post office each morning and sort it for their route—the specific area they deliver to."</li>
                        <li>"They walk or drive to every house and business on their route, delivering letters, bills, magazines, cards, and packages."</li>
                        <li>"Rain or shine, hot or cold, mail carriers work hard to make sure everyone gets their mail every day."</li>
                        <li>"When you send a letter, you write an address on it and add a stamp. The post office picks it up, and mail carriers deliver it to the person whose address you wrote."</li>
                        <li>"Mail carriers help people stay in touch with family and friends, receive important information, and get items they've ordered."</li>
                        <li>"Being a mail carrier requires responsibility, organization, and dedication—they make sure every piece of mail goes to the right place."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Ask: "Why are mail carriers important?" (They deliver mail, help people stay connected, bring packages.)</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Write and Decorate a Letter (4-5 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Give your student paper, an envelope, and drawing materials. Say: "Let's write a letter to someone we care about!"</p>
                    <p>Help them:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Write a short message: "Dear [name], I hope you are doing well! Love, [student's name]"</li>
                        <li>Draw a picture on the letter</li>
                        <li>Fold it and put it in an envelope</li>
                        <li>Write the recipient's name on the front (or pretend address)</li>
                        <li>Draw a stamp in the upper right corner</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As they work, reinforce: "Mail carriers deliver millions of letters and packages every day. They chose a job that keeps communities connected."</p>

                    <h4>Practice (3-4 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask review questions:</p>

                        <li>"What do mail carriers do?" (Deliver letters and packages.)</li>
                        <li>"Where do mail carriers work?" (Post office, and they deliver along their route.)</li>
                        <li>"What do you need to put on a letter to send it?" (Address and stamp.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Discuss: "Who would you like to send a letter to? What would you tell them?"</p>

                    <p>Review the week: "This week you learned about five community helpers: police officers, firefighters, teachers, doctors and nurses, and mail carriers. All of these people chose careers that help others and make our community better."</p>
                    <p>Ask: "Which community helper would you like to thank this week?"</p>
