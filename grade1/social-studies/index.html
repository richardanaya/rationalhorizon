            <h2>American Heritage Foundation</h2>
            <p>
                First grade social studies introduces students to their place in family, community, and country. 
                Through engaging stories and hands-on activities, children learn about American symbols, heroes, 
                and the founding principles that make our nation special. Every lesson builds pride in American 
                heritage and understanding of citizenship.
