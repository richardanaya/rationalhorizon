            <h2>Social Studies Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In the first month of Grade 1 social studies, students explore the foundational elements of
                American civic life, their community, and their family. Through concrete activities and
                age-appropriate discussions, students learn about American symbols and values, discover the
                important roles community helpers play, understand family responsibilities, and develop basic
                map and geography skills. Each lesson emphasizes that society is built by individual people
                making choices and taking actions—students learn to recognize the value of individual
                achievement and the importance of personal responsibility in their family and community.

            <h2>Getting Started: Orientation for New Homeschool Teachers</h2>
            <p>If this is your first time teaching Social Studies at home, here's how to prepare:</p>

            <div class="orientation-steps">
                <h3>Before You Begin</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Review the full week:</strong> Read through all 5 daily lessons before Monday to gather materials and familiarize yourself with the topics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gather materials:</strong> Most materials are household items (paper, crayons, photos) or internet resources (YouTube videos, Midjourney image prompts). Check substitutions if you don't have specific items.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan your schedule:</strong> Each lesson takes 15-20 minutes. Choose a time when your student is receptive to discussion and storytelling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare visuals:</strong> Social studies lessons are enhanced by pictures. Use Midjourney prompts provided in each lesson to generate images, or search online for photos of American symbols, community helpers, and maps.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>During Each Lesson</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start with the objective:</strong> Tell your student what they'll learn today in simple, child-friendly language.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow the 4-part structure:</strong> Introduction → Main Activity → Practice → Closure. Adjust timing based on your student's engagement and questions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encourage discussion:</strong> Social studies is about ideas and people. Ask your student questions, listen to their observations, and help them make connections to their own life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the assessment questions:</strong> These quick checks help you know if your student understood the key concepts before moving forward.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Supplemental Resources (Optional)</h3>
                <p>Many lessons include optional YouTube videos (patriotic songs, videos about community helpers), library book suggestions, and Midjourney prompts for creating visual aids. These are enhancements, not requirements. Use them if they fit your family's schedule and resources.</p>
