                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Printed flag image</strong> → Show flag image on computer/tablet screen, or go outside to find a real flag in your neighborhood</li>

                <h3>Procedure</h3>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (3-4 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Show your student a picture of the American flag. Ask: "Have you seen this flag before? Where?" (Outside buildings, at schools, on holidays, etc.)</p>
                    <p>Say: "This is the American flag. It's a very special symbol that represents our country, the United States of America. Symbols are pictures or objects that stand for something important. When we see this flag, we think of our country and the freedoms we have."</p>
                    <p>Point to different parts: "Let's look at the colors. What colors do you see?" (Red, white, and blue.) "And what shapes?" (Stars and stripes.)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: Explore the Flag's Design (4 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Point to the blue rectangle with stars: "This blue section has 50 white stars. Each star stands for one of the 50 states in America. Can you count some of the stars with me?" (Count 5-10 stars together.)</p>
                    <p>Point to the red and white stripes: "Now let's count the stripes. How many do you see?" (Count together: 13 stripes total.) "These 13 stripes represent the original 13 colonies—the first 13 states that formed our country a long time ago."</p>
                    <p>Explain: "So the flag tells a story! The stars show how many states we have now, and the stripes remind us of where America began."</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Create Your Own Flag (5-6 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Give your student white paper and red and blue crayons. Say: "Let's draw our own American flag! First, color a blue rectangle in the top left corner for the stars."</p>
                    <p>Help them draw or use star stickers to add several stars in the blue section (doesn't need to be 50—even 5-10 stars is fine for young students).</p>
                    <p>Next, help them draw 13 horizontal stripes across the rest of the page: "We'll make some stripes red and some white. Let's count as we color: red, white, red, white..." (Alternate red and white stripes.)</p>
                    <p>As they work, reinforce: "You're making the American flag! This flag represents all Americans and the freedom we have to make our own choices and follow our dreams."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (3-4 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Once the flag is complete, ask review questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"What are the three colors on our flag?" (Red, white, and blue.)</li>
                        <li>"What do the stars stand for?" (The 50 states.)</li>
                        <li>"What do the stripes stand for?" (The 13 original colonies.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Say: "Great job! You know all about the American flag now. This flag is a symbol of our country. When you see it flying, remember that it stands for America and the freedom we have."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Hold up the student's flag drawing and celebrate: "You created your own American flag! Let's hang it up where we can see it this week."</p>
                    <p>Ask: "Why is the American flag important?" (It represents our country and our freedom.)</p>
                    <p>Preview tomorrow's lesson: "Tomorrow we're going to learn a special pledge—words we say to show respect for the American flag."</p>

                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Display the American flag. Say: "Yesterday we learned about the American flag. Today we're going to learn special words called the Pledge of Allegiance. A pledge is a promise. When we say the Pledge of Allegiance, we're promising to be loyal to our country."</p>

                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (10-12 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: Learn the Pledge Line by Line (7-8 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Show the written Pledge and read it slowly together, breaking it into small parts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"I pledge allegiance"</strong> - "This means 'I promise to be loyal.'"</li>
                        <li><strong>"to the Flag"</strong> - "We're making this promise to our flag and what it represents."</li>
                        <li><strong>"of the United States of America"</strong> - "The flag represents our country, America."</li>
                        <li><strong>"and to the Republic for which it stands"</strong> - "A republic is a type of government where people choose leaders." (Keep this simple for first graders.)</li>
                        <li><strong>"one Nation under God, indivisible"</strong> - "We are one country, united together and cannot be divided."</li>
                        <li><strong>"with liberty and justice for all"</strong> - "Liberty means freedom. Justice means fairness. We want freedom and fairness for everyone."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Repeat the full Pledge 2-3 times slowly, with your student following along.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Practice Together (3-4 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Stand together with hand over heart. Say the Pledge together 2-3 times at a comfortable pace. It's okay if your student doesn't have every word memorized yet—this is about learning the meaning and showing respect.</p>
                    <p>Encourage: "You're learning an important American tradition! Millions of Americans say these words to show love for their country."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (3-4 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask comprehension questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"What does 'pledge' mean?" (A promise.)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>

                    <p>Ask: "What are you promising when you say the Pledge?" (To be loyal to America, to support freedom and fairness for everyone.)</p>
                    <p>Preview: "Tomorrow we'll learn about another American symbol—a very special bird!"</p>

                    <h4>Introduction (3-4 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Show your student a picture of a bald eagle. Ask: "What kind of animal is this? What do you notice about it?" (It's a bird, it has a white head, sharp beak, large wings, etc.)</p>
                    <p>Say: "This is a bald eagle. It's America's national bird—that means it's a special symbol of our country, just like the flag. The bald eagle was chosen because it represents strength, freedom, and courage."</p>
                    <p>Explain: "The eagle isn't really bald—it has white feathers on its head! Its body is brown, and it has powerful wings that can spread very wide. Eagles can fly high in the sky and see great distances."</p>

                    <p>Share interesting facts about bald eagles:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Bald eagles are strong and powerful birds of prey. They hunt for fish and small animals."</li>
                        <li>"They build huge nests in tall trees and take care of their babies."</li>
                        <li>"An eagle's wingspan can be 6-7 feet wide—wider than a grown-up is tall!"</li>
                        <li>"Eagles can fly very high—up to 10,000 feet in the air. From up there, they can see prey on the ground."</li>
                        <li>"America chose the bald eagle as a symbol because eagles are brave, independent, and strong."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Ask: "Why do you think the bald eagle is a good symbol for America?" (Strong, free, brave, independent.)</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Draw a Bald Eagle (4-5 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Give your student paper and drawing materials. Say: "Let's draw our own bald eagle!"</p>
                    <p>Guide them to draw:</p>

                        <li>A white head (top of the page)</li>
                        <li>A yellow, curved beak</li>
                        <li>A large brown body</li>
                        <li>Two wide wings spread out to the sides</li>
                        <li>Optional: yellow talons (claws)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As they draw, reinforce: "This eagle is a symbol of our country. When you see an eagle on coins, buildings, or flags, remember that it stands for America's strength and freedom."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">

                        <li><strong>American Flag:</strong> "What are the three colors? What do the stars represent? What do the stripes represent?"</li>
                        <li><strong>Pledge of Allegiance:</strong> "Let's stand and say the Pledge together." (Recite together.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Bald Eagle:</strong> "What is America's national bird? What does the eagle represent?"</li>
                        <li><strong>Statue of Liberty:</strong> "Where is the Statue of Liberty located? What does she hold? What does she represent?"</li>
                        <li><strong>Liberty Bell:</strong> "Where is the Liberty Bell? What does it symbolize? What special feature does it have?" (The crack.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Celebrate correct answers: "You remember so much! You're becoming an expert on American symbols!"</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Create a Symbols Poster (4-5 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Give your student a large piece of paper. Say: "Let's create a poster showing all four American symbols we learned about this week."</p>
                    <p>Help them divide the paper into four sections and draw small versions of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>American flag</li>
                        <li>Bald eagle</li>
                        <li>Statue of Liberty</li>
                        <li>Liberty Bell</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>At the top of the poster, write: "American Symbols" or "Symbols of Freedom."</p>
                    <p>As they work, reinforce: "All of these symbols represent American values like freedom, strength, courage, and independence."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (3-4 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Play a quick identification game. Show images of the symbols one at a time and ask your student to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Name the symbol</li>
                        <li>Say one thing it represents</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>For example: "This is the bald eagle. It represents strength and freedom."</p>
                    <p>Praise their knowledge: "You know all four symbols! Excellent work this week!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Stand together and recite the Pledge of Allegiance one final time, facing the flag or flag drawing.</p>
                    <p>Say: "This week you learned about important American symbols and what they represent. You learned that America values freedom, strength, courage, and individual rights. These symbols remind us of these important values."</p>
                    <p>Optional: Create a simple "American Symbols Expert" certificate for your student to celebrate their learning.</p>
                    <p>Preview next week: "Next week we'll learn about people in our community who help us—community helpers!"</p>

                    <li>Can the student correctly identify all four symbols learned this week? (Flag, eagle, Statue of Liberty, Liberty Bell)</li>
                    <li>Ask: "What do all of these symbols represent?" - Expected: "America" or "Freedom" or "American values"</li>
                    <li>Can the student recite most of the Pledge of Allegiance with minimal prompting?</li>
