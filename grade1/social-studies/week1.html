            <h2>Week 1 Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This foundational week helps students understand their own identity and what makes them unique 
                individuals. Children will explore their personal characteristics, interests, and abilities while 
                learning to appreciate both similarities and differences among classmates. This builds the foundation 
                for understanding how individuals contribute to families, communities, and our nation.

                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>Using Your Mind (Reason)</h4>
                    <p>Children learn to observe and think about themselves objectively. They use evidence (what they see in mirrors, what they can do) to understand their own characteristics and abilities. This builds rational self-knowledge based on facts, not feelings.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>Learning Real Things (Reality)</h4>
                    <p>All self-discovery is based on observable reality - actual eye color, real talents they can demonstrate, preferences they truly feel. Children learn that their identity is based on real, objective characteristics, not on what others say about them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>Learning Helps Me (Self-Interest)</h4>
                    <p>Understanding themselves helps children make better choices, communicate their needs, and develop their talents. They see how self-knowledge empowers them to pursue what they enjoy and excel at what they do well.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>I Am Important (Individual Worth)</h4>
                    <p>This entire week celebrates each child as a unique individual worthy of respect and appreciation. Every child's characteristics, preferences, and talents are valued equally. They learn that being different from others is not just okay - it's valuable and important.</p>
