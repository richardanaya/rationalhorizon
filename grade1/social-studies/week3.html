            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will identify different family roles and understand their own responsibilities within the family.</p>
            <p>This week introduces students to the concept of family roles and personal responsibilities. Students will learn that families work best when each member contributes by completing age-appropriate tasks and helping others. Each lesson emphasizes personal responsibility, the value of contributing to the family team, and the satisfaction that comes from completing tasks well and helping those you care about.</p>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (3-4 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask: "Who lives in your house? Who are the people in your family?"</p>
                    <p>Say: "A family is a group of people who care about each other, live together, and help each other. Families come in all different sizes and types. Some families are big with many people, and some families are small. But all families have one thing in common—they care for each other."</p>
                    <p>Explain: "Families can include parents, children, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and even close friends who are like family. The most important thing is that family members love and support each other."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: Talk About Your Family (4-5 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Ask your student to tell you about their family:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Who lives in your house?"</li>
                        <li>"What are their names?"</li>
                        <li>"What does each person like to do?"</li>
                        <li>"Who takes care of you?"</li>
                        <li>"Who do you play with?"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Affirm: "Your family is special and unique! Every family is different, and that's wonderful."</p>
                    <p>Explain: "In a family, everyone has a role. Adults usually take care of children, make sure everyone has food and a place to live, and keep everyone safe. Children learn, grow, and help out in age-appropriate ways."</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Draw Your Family (4-5 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Give your student paper and drawing materials. Say: "Let's draw a picture of your family!"</p>
                    <p>Help them draw all the people who live in their home (or extended family members they're close to). Encourage them to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Draw each person with details (hair color, favorite clothes, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Add labels with names under each person</li>
                        <li>Optional: Draw a house or background showing where the family lives</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As they draw, talk about what makes each family member special.</p>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (3-4 minutes)</h4>

                        <li>"What is a family?" (A group of people who care for each other, live together, and help each other.)</li>

                        <li>"What are some things families do together?" (Eat meals, play, help each other, celebrate special occasions.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Affirm: "Your family loves you and wants you to grow into a capable, responsible person!"</p>

                    <h4>Introduction (3-4 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask: "Do you help out at home? What jobs do you do?"</p>
                    <p>Say: "Just like adults have jobs to do at home, children can also help! When you do your part, you're contributing to the family. This means you're being responsible and helping the family run smoothly. Today we'll learn about jobs that children your age can do."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: Learn About Age-Appropriate Chores (5-6 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Make a list together of jobs 6-7 year olds can do. Examples include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Make your bed:</strong> Pull up the blankets and arrange pillows</li>
                        <li><strong>Put toys away:</strong> Return toys to their proper places after playing</li>
                        <li><strong>Set the table:</strong> Put plates, cups, and utensils on the table before meals</li>
                        <li><strong>Clear your plate:</strong> Take your dishes to the sink after eating</li>
                        <li><strong>Feed pets:</strong> Put food and water in pet bowls (with adult supervision)</li>
                        <li><strong>Water plants:</strong> Help water indoor or outdoor plants</li>
                        <li><strong>Sort laundry:</strong> Put dirty clothes in the laundry basket or sort clean clothes by color</li>
                        <li><strong>Dust low surfaces:</strong> Wipe low shelves or tables with a cloth</li>
                        <li><strong>Help put groceries away:</strong> Put non-breakable items in cupboards</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep your room tidy:</strong> Pick up clothes, books, and belongings</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Explain: "These jobs might seem small, but they really help your family! When you do your chores, adults have more time to spend playing with you or doing other important things."</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Draw Yourself Doing a Chore (3-4 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Give your student paper and drawing materials. Say: "Draw a picture of yourself doing one of these chores!"</p>
                    <p>Help them choose a chore they do (or would like to start doing) and draw themselves completing it.</p>
                    <p>As they draw, discuss: "How does it feel when you help your family?" (Proud, helpful, responsible.)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (3-4 minutes)</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"Name three chores that children your age can do" (Any three from the list)</li>
                        <li>"Why is it important for children to help at home?" (It helps the family, shows responsibility, makes things easier for everyone.)</li>
                        <li>"Which chore do you think you could do really well?"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Say: "When you do your chores without being reminded, you show that you're growing up and becoming more responsible!"</p>

                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>

                    <p>Ask: "What's one chore you'll try to do this week without being asked?"</p>

                    <p>Explain the concept of family teamwork:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"When everyone in a family helps out, the work gets done faster and no one person is overwhelmed."</li>

                        <li>"Families can work together on big projects, like cleaning the yard, preparing for a party, or going on a trip."</li>
                        <li>"Working together also makes the family stronger—you learn to cooperate, communicate, and appreciate each other."</li>
                        <li>"Even small children can contribute. Every bit helps!"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Teamwork Activity (Optional, 4-5 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Do a quick teamwork activity to demonstrate the power of cooperation:</p>
                    <p><strong>Option A: Building Together</strong> - Give your student blocks or books and challenge them to build something. Then show how it's easier and faster when you help too.</p>
                    <p><strong>Option B: Draw Family Teamwork</strong> - Have your student draw a picture of their family working together on a project (cleaning up, making dinner, raking leaves, etc.).</p>
