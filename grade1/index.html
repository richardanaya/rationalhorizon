            <h2>Building the Foundation</h2>
            <p>
                Grade 1 focuses on developing fundamental capabilities that form the bedrock of all future learning. 
                Students will master <strong>reading fluency</strong>, <strong>basic arithmetic</strong>, 
                <strong>scientific observation</strong>, <strong>American citizenship concepts</strong>, and 
                <strong>story comprehension</strong>. Every lesson builds confidence through achievable goals 
                and celebrates the child's growing independence as a learner and thinker.

            <h3>What Principles Matter for 6-7 Year Olds</h3>
            <div class="principles-grid">
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>Using Your Mind (Reason)</h4>
                    <p><strong>At this age:</strong> Children naturally ask "Why?" about everything. We teach them that their questions are valuable and that they can figure things out by looking carefully and thinking step-by-step.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Six-year-olds are building confidence in their thinking abilities. When they learn that their mind is reliable, they become eager, independent learners.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>Learning Real Things (Reality)</h4>
                    <p><strong>At this age:</strong> Children learn best through hands-on experiences. We use real objects to teach math, real books for reading, and real places to learn geography.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> First graders are naturally curious about the world around them. Connecting learning to real, concrete things makes knowledge stick and builds trust in their senses.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>Learning Helps Me (Self-Interest)</h4>
                    <p><strong>At this age:</strong> Children understand "What's in it for me?" We show them how reading helps them enjoy stories, how math helps them count their toys, and how knowledge makes them capable.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Six-year-olds are developing their sense of competence. When they see that learning directly benefits them, they become motivated and excited about school.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>I Am Important (Individual Worth)</h4>
                    <p><strong>At this age:</strong> Children are discovering their unique personalities and abilities. We celebrate each child's progress and never compare them to others.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> First graders are building their self-concept. When they feel valued as individuals, they develop healthy self-esteem and confidence to tackle challenges.</p>
