            <h2>Reading Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In the first month of Grade 1 reading, students build foundational phonics skills through
                systematic letter sound instruction and blending practice. Using a phonics-first approach,
                students learn that letters represent specific sounds, and these sounds can be combined to
                read and write words. Each lesson emphasizes that reading is a skill based on understanding
                the reliable relationship between letters and sounds—not guessing or memorization. Students
                learn to decode words methodically, building confidence as independent readers who can tackle
                new words using phonics strategies.

            <h2>Weekly Lesson Plans</h2>
            <p>Each week contains 5 daily lessons (Monday-Friday), each designed for 15-20 minutes of focused phonics instruction.</p>

            <div class="progression-overview">
                <!-- Week 1 -->
                <div class="week-card">
                    <h3>Week 1: Letter Sounds A-E</h3>
                    <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will learn the sounds for the first five letters (A, B, C, D, E) and begin blending simple words with these sounds.</p>
                    <p class="week-summary">Students are introduced to the first five letter sounds through picture associations, sound practice, and beginning blending activities. Each day adds one new letter sound and includes practice writing the letter and identifying its sound in words.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started: Orientation for New Homeschool Teachers</h2>
            <p>If this is your first time teaching Reading at home, here's how to prepare:</p>

            <div class="orientation-steps">
                <h3>Before You Begin</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Review the phonics approach:</strong> Read through Week 1 lessons to understand the systematic phonics method. Each letter is taught with its most common sound first.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gather materials:</strong> You'll need basic supplies: paper, pencils, crayons, and household objects for letter sound activities. All materials have substitutions listed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice letter sounds yourself:</strong> Make sure you know the correct sounds for each letter (e.g., "A" says /æ/ as in "apple," not "ay"). YouTube videos are linked for reference.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create a quiet reading space:</strong> Set up a comfortable area free from distractions where your student can focus during 15-20 minute lessons.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>During Each Lesson</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start with the objective:</strong> Tell your student which letter sound they'll learn today and why it's important.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow the 4-part structure:</strong> Introduction → Main Activity → Practice → Closure. Each part has clear guidance and timing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use multi-sensory practice:</strong> Have students say the sound, trace the letter, and find objects that start with that sound. Movement and touch help cement learning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it positive:</strong> Early reading can be challenging. Celebrate every correct sound and word. Focus on progress, not perfection.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Supplemental Resources (Optional)</h3>
                <p>Many lessons include optional YouTube phonics videos, library book suggestions, and printable activities. These are enhancements, not requirements. Use them if they fit your family's schedule and resources. YouTube read-aloud alternatives are provided for all recommended books.</p>
