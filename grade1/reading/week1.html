            <h2>Week 1 Overview</h2>
            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will learn the sounds for the first five letters (A, B, C, D, E) and begin blending simple words with these sounds.</p>
            <p>This week introduces phonics as the foundation of reading. Students learn that each letter represents a specific sound, and when we put sounds together, we can read words. Each day focuses on one new letter sound with multi-sensory practice: saying the sound, writing the letter, and finding objects that begin with that sound. By Friday, students will recognize all five letter sounds and begin blending them into simple words.</p>

                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="lesson-procedure">
                <h3>Procedure</h3>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Hold up an apple (or picture of an apple). Ask: "What is this?" (Apple!) "What sound do you hear at the beginning of 'apple'? Listen: /æ/-/æ/-apple." Emphasize the short "a" sound.</p>
                    <p>Show the letter card with "A". Say: "This is the letter A. The letter A makes the /æ/ sound, just like the beginning of apple. When we see this letter, we say /æ/."</p>
                    <p>Explain: "Today we're starting our journey to become readers! Reading is about knowing that letters make sounds, and when we put sounds together, we can read words. Let's learn our first letter sound."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: Sound Practice (3 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Say: "Let's practice the /æ/ sound together." Repeat the sound 5-6 times with your student: "/æ/, /æ/, /æ/."</p>
                    <p>Exaggerate the mouth position: "Feel how your mouth opens wide when you say /æ/? That's the A sound."</p>
                    <p>Point to the letter A and say: "Every time you see this letter, you say /æ/."</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Object Identification (3 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Show 3-5 objects or pictures. Say: "Let's find things that start with the /æ/ sound."</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apple - "Does apple start with /æ/? Yes! /æ/-apple."</li>
                        <li>Ant - "Does ant start with /æ/? Yes! /æ/-ant."</li>
                        <li>Alligator - "Does alligator start with /æ/? Yes! /æ/-alligator."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Include 1-2 objects that do NOT start with A (like "ball" or "cat"). Ask: "Does ball start with /æ/? No! Ball starts with /b/."</p>
                    <p>This helps students discriminate the /æ/ sound from other sounds.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 3: Letter Writing (2-3 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Show how to write uppercase "A": "A starts at the top with a slant down-left, then slant down-right, then a line across the middle. It looks like a tent or a mountain."</p>
                    <p>Show lowercase "a": "Lowercase a is a circle with a line down on the right side."</p>
                    <p>Have your student practice writing A and a on paper. If available, let them trace the letter in a sand tray or shaving cream for multi-sensory practice.</p>
                    <p>As they write, have them say the sound: "/æ/, /æ/, /æ/."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Sound Hunt:</strong> Walk around your home together and find 5 objects that start with the /æ/ sound. Examples: apple, apron, astronaut toy, alphabet book, arm (point to your arm), ankle, etc.</p>
                    <p>Each time you find one, say: "What's this?" (Apple!) "What sound does it start with?" (/æ/!) "What letter makes that sound?" (A!)</p>
                    <p><strong>Drawing Activity:</strong> Have your student draw a picture of something that starts with A (like an apple) and write the letter A next to it. This connects the sound, the letter, and a concrete object.</p>
                    <p>Say the sound multiple times during practice: "We're looking for things that start with /æ/, the A sound."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask: "What letter did we learn today?" (A!) "What sound does A make?" (/æ/!)</p>
                    <p>Point to the letter A card: "When you see this letter in a book or on a sign, what sound will you say?" (/æ/!)</p>
                    <p>Celebrate: "You learned your first letter sound! That's the beginning of reading. Every time you see A, you'll know it says /æ/. Tomorrow we'll learn the sound for letter B."</p>
                    <p>Give a high-five: "Great job, reader!"</p>
