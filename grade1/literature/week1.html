            <h2>Week 1 Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This classic tale introduces students to the power of literature while teaching important life lessons 
                about hard work, preparation, and making wise choices. Through "The Three Little Pigs," children 
                will explore story elements, develop listening skills, and discuss how the characters' different 
                approaches to building their homes led to very different outcomes.

                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>Using Your Mind (Reason)</h4>
                    <p>Children analyze cause and effect in the story: the third pig thought ahead, worked harder, and achieved better results. They learn to evaluate characters' choices logically and understand that decisions have predictable consequences.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>Learning Real Things (Reality)</h4>
                    <p>The story's lesson reflects real-world principles: quality materials and careful work create stronger results than hasty shortcuts. Children connect the fictional tale to actual experiences with building, preparing, and working hard.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>Learning Helps Me (Self-Interest)</h4>
                    <p>Children see how the story's lesson benefits them personally: when they work carefully on projects, prepare for challenges, and choose quality over speed, they achieve better outcomes and feel proud of their accomplishments.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>I Am Important (Individual Worth)</h4>
                    <p>Each child's interpretation and response to the story is valued. Whether they relate to the hardworking third pig or understand the first two pigs' desire for quick results, every perspective contributes to rich class discussions about character and choice.</p>
