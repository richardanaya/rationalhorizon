            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will identify main characters and understand story sequence (beginning, middle, end) in classic picture books.</p>
            <p>This week introduces beloved picture books that have delighted children for generations. Each story features memorable characters and clear plots that help students understand how stories work. Through read-aloud sessions and discussions, students learn to identify who is in the story, where it takes place, and what happens from start to finish. These classic books provide a foundation for understanding narrative structure while exposing students to rich vocabulary and timeless themes.</p>

                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Show the cover of "Corduroy" and ask: "What do you see on the cover?" Point out Corduroy, the small bear in green overalls. Ask: "Do you have a favorite stuffed animal or toy? How does it make you feel?"</p>
                    <p>Say: "Today we're going to read about a toy bear named Corduroy who lives in a store and wants something very special—a home and a friend. As we read, let's think about who is in the story (characters), where it happens (setting), and what problem Corduroy needs to solve."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (10-12 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Read-Aloud (8-10 minutes):</strong></p>
                    <p>Read "Corduroy" aloud with expression. Pause at key moments to show illustrations clearly. Use different voices for Corduroy, Lisa, and the night watchman to bring characters to life.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key pauses for discussion:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When Lisa first sees Corduroy: "How do you think Lisa feels about Corduroy?"</li>
                        <li>When Corduroy's button is missing: "What is Corduroy's problem?"</li>
                        <li>When Corduroy searches at night: "Where is Corduroy looking? What does he think the escalator is?"</li>
                        <li>When Lisa takes Corduroy home: "How does Corduroy feel now? How do you know?"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Post-Reading Discussion (2 minutes):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Who is the main character?" (Corduroy, the teddy bear)</li>
                        <li>"Where does the story happen?" (A department store, then Lisa's home)</li>
                        <li>"What was Corduroy's problem?" (He was missing a button and wanted a friend and home)</li>
                        <li>"How did the problem get solved?" (Lisa bought him and sewed on a new button)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (3-5 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Story Sequence Activity:</strong> Help your student retell the story in order using "beginning, middle, end" structure.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Beginning:</strong> "First, Corduroy was in the toy department and Lisa saw him..."</li>

                        <li><strong>End:</strong> "Finally, Lisa brought Corduroy home and they became friends..."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If time allows, have your student draw Corduroy and label his missing button, then show him with his new button.</p>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (1-2 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask: "Why do you think Lisa wanted Corduroy even though he was missing a button?" (She saw that he was special, she wanted to be his friend.)</p>
                    <p>Connect to values: "This story shows us that friends care about each other and accept us even when we're not perfect. Lisa didn't care that Corduroy was missing a button—she loved him just the way he was."</p>
                    <p>Preview: "Tomorrow we'll read about a boy who wakes up to find snow! It's called 'The Snowy Day.'"</p>

                <p>This week, your student explored five classic picture books and learned to identify story elements: characters (who), setting (where), and plot (what happens with beginning, middle, and end). They practiced retelling stories in sequence and making connections between stories and their own lives. These comprehension skills form the foundation for all future reading and literature study. Next week, we'll discover American folk tales and learn about legendary heroes!</p>
