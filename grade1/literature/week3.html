            <h2>Week 3 Overview</h2>
            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will follow a longer story over multiple days, track plot development, and make predictions about what will happen next.</p>
            <p>This week introduces students to their first chapter book experience. Instead of reading a complete story in one sitting, we'll read a few pages or one short chapter each day, following the same characters and plot throughout the entire week. This builds memory skills, prediction abilities, and the patience to enjoy a sustained narrative. Students learn to remember what happened previously, make connections between different parts of the story, and anticipate future events. This week features "Frog and Toad Are Friends" by Arnold Lobel—a perfect first chapter book with five separate short stories that we'll read one per day.</p>
