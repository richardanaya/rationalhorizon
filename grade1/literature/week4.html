            <h2>Week 4 Overview</h2>
            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will appreciate rhyme, rhythm, and descriptive language in poetry and rhyming picture books, building vocabulary and phonemic awareness.</p>
            <p>This week explores the musical quality of language through poems and rhyming stories. Poetry introduces students to rhythm, repetition, rhyme patterns, and vivid descriptive language. These elements help develop phonemic awareness (hearing sounds in words), expand vocabulary, and teach students that language can be beautiful, playful, and fun. Each day features different poems or rhyming books with activities to act out, recite, and enjoy the sounds and patterns of language.</p>

                <h3>Week 4 Complete!</h3>
                <p>This week, your student discovered the joy of poetry and rhyming language! They explored nursery rhymes, Dr. Seuss's playful wordplay, Shel Silverstein's humorous poems, alphabet rhythms, and action chants. Through these experiences, they developed phonemic awareness (hearing sounds in words), expanded vocabulary, and learned that language can be beautiful, funny, and fun. Poetry helps children appreciate the music and rhythm of language, which supports reading development and creative expression.</p>

                <h3>Month 1 Literature Complete!</h3>
                <p>Congratulations! Your student has completed the first month of Grade 1 Literature. Over four weeks, they experienced classic picture books, American folk tales, their first chapter book, and diverse forms of poetry. They learned to identify story elements (characters, setting, plot), understand morals and themes, follow sustained narratives, and appreciate the beauty of language. These foundational comprehension skills and love of literature will serve them throughout their educational journey. Keep reading together and celebrating the power of stories!</p>
