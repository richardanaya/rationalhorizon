                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask: "Have you ever done a chore or job all by yourself when others wouldn't help? How did that feel?" Today's story is about a hardworking hen who asks for help many times, but nobody wants to help her. Let's see what happens!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (10-12 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Read "The Little Red Hen" aloud. Use different voices for the hen and the lazy animals (cat, dog, pig). Emphasize the repeated pattern: "Who will help me?" "Not I!"</p>
                    <p><strong>Discussion questions during reading:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"What did the little red hen ask the other animals to help with?"</li>

                        <li>"How do you think the little red hen felt when nobody would help?"</li>
                        <li>"What happened at the end when the bread was ready to eat?"</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (3-5 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Discuss the moral: "If you don't help with the work, you don't get to enjoy the reward. The little red hen worked hard from start to finish, so she earned the right to eat the bread."</p>
                    <p>Ask: "Was it fair that the little red hen didn't share? Why or why not?" (Guide toward understanding that those who work hard deserve to enjoy the results)</p>
                    <p>Connection: "When have you worked hard and earned something you felt proud of?"</p>
