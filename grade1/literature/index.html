            <h2>Literature Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In the first month of Grade 1 literature, students develop listening comprehension, vocabulary,
                and critical thinking skills through carefully selected read-aloud books. Each day features
                a different story with discussion questions that help students identify characters, understand
                story sequence, and make connections between the story and their own experiences. The read-aloud
                approach allows students to enjoy rich, complex stories beyond their independent reading level,
                building their understanding of narrative structure and expanding their knowledge of the world.
                Students learn that stories reflect reality—real emotions, real problems, real solutions—and that
                thinking carefully about what we read helps us understand both the story and ourselves better.

        <!-- Teacher Orientation for Week 1 -->
        <section class="teacher-orientation">
            <h2>Getting Started: Orientation for New Homeschool Teachers</h2>
            <p>If this is your first time conducting read-alouds at home, here's how to prepare:</p>

            <div class="orientation-steps">
                <h3>Before You Begin</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Choose your book source:</strong> Check your local library for the recommended books, or use the YouTube read-aloud links provided as free alternatives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preview the book:</strong> Read or watch the story yourself before the lesson so you know what happens and can prepare discussion questions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare your space:</strong> Create a comfortable reading spot with good lighting. Sit next to your student so they can see the pictures clearly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan for interruptions:</strong> It's natural for young children to ask questions during the story. Pause to answer briefly, then continue reading to maintain the flow.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>During Each Read-Aloud</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Read with expression:</strong> Use different voices for characters, vary your pace for excitement or suspense, and show enthusiasm for the story.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show the pictures:</strong> After reading each page, pause to let your student see the illustrations. Pictures provide important context and help with comprehension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow the discussion questions:</strong> Use the provided questions to check understanding and encourage critical thinking. There are no "wrong" answers—focus on helping your student explain their thinking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it enjoyable:</strong> Reading should be a pleasant experience. If your student is restless, take a quick stretch break and return to the story.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Book Access Options</h3>
                <p>Every lesson includes multiple ways to access the books:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Library:</strong> Borrow physical books from your local library (recommended for the best reading experience)</li>
                    <li><strong>YouTube:</strong> Watch narrated read-alouds online for free (provided links for every book)</li>
                    <li><strong>Substitutions:</strong> Alternative book suggestions if the primary book is unavailable</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No family should be blocked from literature lessons due to book access—we provide free alternatives for every title.</p>
