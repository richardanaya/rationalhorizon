            <p>
                First grade literature introduces students to the world's greatest stories, focusing on tales that 
                celebrate courage, honesty, hard work, and individual achievement. Through carefully selected books, 
                children develop vocabulary, comprehension skills, and most importantly, a love for stories that 
                inspire them to be their best selves.
