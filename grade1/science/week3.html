            <h2>Week 3 Overview</h2>
            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will observe and describe animal characteristics, behaviors, and basic needs.</p>
            <p>Building on observation skills developed in weeks 1 and 2, students now explore another group of living things—animals. Through careful observation of pets, backyard wildlife, pictures, and videos, students learn to describe animal body parts, how animals move, what they eat, and where they live. Students discover that animals, like plants, have specific needs (food, water, shelter) that must be met for survival. By Friday, students understand how to observe animals scientifically and can describe the characteristics that make each animal unique.</p>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Say: "Last week we observed plants. This week we'll observe animals. Animals are living things that can move around to find food and water."</p>
                    <p>Ask: "What animals have you seen? Can you name some?" Let your student list animals they know (dog, cat, bird, fish, etc.).</p>
                    <p>Say: "Today we'll observe animal body parts and learn how different parts help animals survive."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Observing a Dog or Cat (or picture of one):</strong></p>
                    <p>Look at a dog (in person, picture, or video). Point out the body parts together:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Head:</strong> Where the brain, eyes, ears, nose, and mouth are. The head helps the animal see, hear, smell, and eat.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eyes:</strong> For seeing food, danger, and where to go.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ears:</strong> For hearing sounds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mouth:</strong> For eating and drinking. Some animals have teeth, some have beaks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Body:</strong> The main part that holds all the organs (like stomach and heart).</li>
                        <li><strong>Legs:</strong> For walking, running, and jumping. Count how many legs (dog has 4).</li>
                        <li><strong>Tail:</strong> Helps with balance and communication.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Comparing Different Animals:</strong> Look at 3-4 different animals (bird, fish, insect, rabbit). Observe how body parts are similar and different:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bird: Has a head, eyes, beak (instead of mouth with teeth), wings (instead of front legs), two legs, feathers, tail.</li>
                        <li>Fish: Has a head, eyes, mouth, body, fins (instead of legs), tail, scales.</li>
                        <li>Insect: Has a head, eyes, mouth, body in sections, six legs, often has wings and antennae.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Say: "All animals have body parts that help them survive. Some have wings to fly. Some have fins to swim. Some have many legs to crawl."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Draw and Label Activity:</strong> Have your student choose an animal (pet, animal from outside, or favorite animal). Draw the animal and label its body parts: head, eyes, ears, mouth, body, legs (or wings/fins), tail.</p>
                    <p>Ask: "How many legs does this animal have?" "Does it have a tail?" "What does it use its eyes for?" "How does this animal move?"</p>
                    <p>Optional: Go outside and observe live animals (birds, squirrels, insects). Point out body parts and discuss how they help the animal.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask: "Can you name some body parts that most animals have?" (Head, eyes, mouth, body, legs.)</p>
                    <p>Ask: "Why do animals have eyes?" (To see.) "Why do they have legs?" (To move and find food.)</p>
                    <p>Say: "Animal body parts help them survive by finding food, escaping danger, and living in their environment."</p>
                    <p>Preview: "Tomorrow we'll observe how different animals move using their body parts!"</p>

                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Review: "Yesterday we learned about animal body parts. Today we'll see how animals use those parts to move!"</p>
                    <p>Ask: "How do you move from one place to another?" (Walk, run, jump.) "Can you fly?" (No!) "Can fish walk?" (No!) Say: "Different animals move in different ways. Let's observe!"</p>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Observing Different Animal Movements:</strong> Explore 5-6 ways animals move:</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Walking/Running (Dog, Cat, Horse):</strong> Show video or picture. Say: "These animals walk and run on four legs. Their legs move them forward quickly. Legs help them travel to find food and escape danger."</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Flying (Birds, Bats, Insects):</strong> Show a bird flying. Say: "Birds use their wings to fly through the air. Wings are special body parts that push air down so the bird goes up. Flying helps birds travel long distances and escape predators."</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Swimming (Fish, Whales, Ducks):</strong> Show a fish swimming. Say: "Fish use their fins and tails to push through the water. Fins help them steer, and the tail pushes them forward. Fish live in water, so swimming is how they move."</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Hopping (Frogs, Rabbits, Kangaroos):</strong> Show a rabbit hopping. Say: "Some animals hop! They use their strong back legs to jump forward. Hopping can be fast and helps them escape danger."</p>

                    <p><strong>5. Crawling (Babies, Turtles, Caterpillars):</strong> Show an animal crawling. Say: "Crawling means moving on your belly or using lots of legs close to the ground. Babies crawl before they walk. Insects crawl with six legs."</p>

                    <p><strong>6. Slithering (Snakes, Worms):</strong> Show a snake slithering. Say: "Snakes don't have legs! They slither by moving their muscles in waves. Slithering lets them move quietly and through small spaces."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">

                        <li>"Move like a dog!" (Walk on hands and feet)</li>
                        <li>"Move like a bird!" (Flap arms and hop or run)</li>
                        <li>"Move like a fish!" (Wiggle body and pretend to swim)</li>
                        <li>"Move like a frog!" (Hop with legs together)</li>

                    <p>Show pictures of: lion, shark, hawk, wolf, spider. Say: "These animals only eat meat—other animals. Animals that only eat meat are called carnivores."</p>
                    <p>Ask: "What does a lion eat?" (Other animals like zebras or antelope.) Point out: "Carnivores often have sharp teeth and claws for catching and eating prey."</p>

                    <p><strong>Category 3: Omnivores (Eat Both)</strong></p>
                    <p>Show pictures of: bear, human, dog, pig, chicken. Say: "These animals eat both plants AND meat. Animals that eat both are called omnivores."</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Birds in Trees (Nests):</strong> Show a bird's nest. Say: "Birds build nests in trees using twigs, grass, and leaves. Nests keep eggs safe and provide a home for baby birds. Trees give birds a high, safe place away from predators."</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Fish in Water (Oceans, Rivers, Ponds):</strong> Show fish swimming. Say: "Fish live in water—oceans, rivers, lakes, and ponds. Water provides everything fish need: food, oxygen (through their gills), and a place to swim and hide from predators."</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Underground (Burrows, Holes):</strong> Show a rabbit burrow or ant hill. Say: "Some animals live underground in burrows or tunnels. Rabbits dig burrows. Ants build underground tunnels. Living underground keeps them safe from weather and predators."</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Forest (Trees, Caves, Dens):</strong> Show forest animals (bear in a den, deer in trees, squirrels in tree holes). Say: "Many animals live in forests where there are lots of trees, plants, and shelter. Bears sleep in dens (caves or hollow logs). Squirrels live in tree holes."</p>

                    <p><strong>5. Backyard (Your Neighborhood):</strong> Say: "Some animals live right near us! Birds, squirrels, insects, and sometimes rabbits or deer live in our backyards. They find food, water, and places to hide in our yards."</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Body Parts:</strong> "What body parts do you see? Does it have a head? Eyes? Ears? How many legs? Does it have a tail? Wings? Fur or feathers or scales?"</p>

                    <p><strong>2. How It Moves:</strong> "Watch how this animal moves. Does it walk, run, fly, swim, hop, crawl, or slither? What body parts does it use to move?"</p>

                    <p><strong>3. What It Eats:</strong> "What do you think this animal eats? Plants? Meat? Both? Is it a herbivore, carnivore, or omnivore? How can you tell?"</p>

                    <li>Show an animal and ask student to describe it completely - Expected: Provides at least 3 out of 4 categories (body parts, movement, diet, habitat)</li>
                    <li>Ask: "How would you describe this animal to someone who has never seen it?" - Expected: Uses scientific observation vocabulary learned this week</li>
                    <li>Overall Week 3 Assessment: Can the student observe and describe animals using correct terminology? - Expected: Yes, demonstrates understanding of animal characteristics</li>

                <h3>Week 3 Complete!</h3>
                <p>This week, your student learned to observe animals as living things with unique characteristics. They can now identify animal body parts (head, eyes, legs, tail, wings) and explain how these parts help animals survive. They discovered that animals move in different ways (walking, flying, swimming, hopping, crawling, slithering) depending on their body structure. They learned that animals fall into three categories based on diet: herbivores (plant-eaters), carnivores (meat-eaters), and omnivores (eat both). Finally, they explored animal habitats and understand that every animal lives in a place that provides food, water, and shelter. Next week, students will observe weather patterns and learn to track changes over time!</p>
