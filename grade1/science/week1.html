            <h2>Week 1 Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This exciting first week introduces students to the world of scientific thinking. Children will learn 
                that scientists are people who ask questions about the world and find answers by looking carefully, 
                making predictions, and testing their ideas. Through hands-on activities, students will begin to 
                see themselves as young scientists capable of discovering how the world works.

                    <h4>Using Your Mind (Reason)</h4>
                    <p>Children learn that their minds are capable of understanding the natural world. They discover that careful observation and logical thinking lead to real knowledge about how things work. Each prediction and observation builds confidence in their reasoning abilities.</p>

                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>Learning Real Things (Reality)</h4>
                    <p>All science investigations use real objects and real phenomena. Children touch actual leaves, observe real weather, and test real materials. They learn that the natural world follows discoverable laws that exist independent of our wishes or opinions.</p>

                    <p>Children see immediately how scientific thinking helps them understand their world better. They can predict which toys will float in the bathtub, ask better questions about animals they see, and feel confident exploring nature because they know how to observe safely.</p>
