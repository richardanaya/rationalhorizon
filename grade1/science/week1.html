            <h2>Week 1 Overview</h2>
            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will identify and use all five senses to observe and describe objects and experiences in their environment.</p>
            <p>This week introduces the foundation of scientific observation: using our five senses to learn about the world. Students discover that each sense—sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell—provides different information. Through hands-on activities with household items and objects from nature, students learn to observe carefully and describe what they notice. By Friday, students understand that scientists use all their senses to gather accurate information about reality.</p>

            <div class="lesson-objective">
                <h3>Learning Objective</h3>
                <p><strong>Student will be able to:</strong> Use the sense of sight to observe and describe the colors, shapes, and sizes of objects in their environment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lesson-materials">
                <h3>Materials Needed</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>5-7 household objects of different colors, shapes, and sizes (toy, book, fruit, cup, spoon, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Paper and crayons or colored pencils</li>
                    <li>Optional: magnifying glass</li>

            <div class="materials-substitutions">
                <h4>Materials Substitutions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Household objects</strong> → anything safe and visible: rocks, leaves, buttons, fabric scraps, kitchen utensils</li>
                    <li><strong>Paper and crayons</strong> → whiteboard, chalkboard, or describe observations verbally</li>
                    <li><strong>Magnifying glass</strong> → not required; children can look closely with their eyes alone</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="lesson-procedure">
                <h3>Procedure</h3>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Point to your eyes and ask: "What do we use these for?" (To see!) Say: "Today we're going to be scientists. Scientists observe the world around them. Observe means to look very carefully and notice things."</p>
                    <p>Hold up an apple (or any colorful object). Say: "When I look at this apple, what do I notice? I see that it's red. I see that it's round. I see that it's about this big." (Show size with hands.) "My eyes tell me so many things!"</p>
                    <p>Say: "Today we're going to practice using our sense of sight to observe objects like scientists do."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: Teacher Models Observation (3 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Place 5-7 objects on the table. Pick up one object (like a blue toy car). Say: "I'm going to observe this object using only my eyes. I will describe what I see."</p>
                    <p>Model careful observation: "I see the color blue. I see it has four black wheels. I see it's about as long as my hand. I see it has windows and doors. I see shiny parts and matte parts."</p>
                    <p>Emphasize: "I used my eyes to notice the color, shape, size, and details. That's what scientists do—they look carefully and describe exactly what they see."</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 2: Guided Observation Together (3 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Pick a different object (like a yellow banana). Say: "Now let's observe this together. What color do you see?" Let your student answer. "What shape is it?" "Is it big or small?" "What else do your eyes notice?"</p>
                    <p>Write down or help your student say complete observation sentences: "I see a yellow banana. I see it is curved. I see it is about as long as my forearm."</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 3: Student Independent Observation (3-4 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Give your student a new object. Say: "Now it's your turn to be the scientist. Look at this object very carefully. Tell me everything your eyes can see."</p>
                    <p>Prompt if needed: "What color is it?" "What shape?" "What size?" "Are there any special details you notice?"</p>
                    <p>If your student is ready, let them observe 2-3 different objects and describe each one.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Draw What You See Activity:</strong> Give your student paper and crayons. Say: "Choose one object and draw exactly what you see. Pay attention to the colors, shapes, and details your eyes notice."</p>
                    <p>As they draw, ask observation questions: "What color are you using? Why?" "What shape did you draw?" "Did you notice any special parts?"</p>
                    <p>When finished, have your student describe their drawing: "I observed a red apple. I saw that it's round. I saw a brown stem on top."</p>
                    <p><strong>Extension (if time allows):</strong> Go on a "sight walk" around your home or outside. Point out things you observe: "I see a green leaf. I see a square window. I see a fluffy cloud."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask: "What sense did we use today to observe?" (Our sense of sight! Our eyes!) "What kinds of things can your eyes tell you about an object?" (Color, shape, size, details.)</p>
                    <p>Say: "Scientists use their eyes to observe the world carefully. Your eyes are important tools for learning about reality."</p>
                    <p>Preview: "Tomorrow we'll use a different sense—our ears! We'll observe with our sense of hearing."</p>

                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Point to your ears and ask: "What do we use these for?" (To hear!) Say: "Yesterday we used our eyes to observe. Today we'll use our ears."</p>
                    <p>Make a sound behind your back (clap, snap, or tap). Ask: "What did you hear? How did you know what sound it was?"</p>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Sound Identification Game:</strong> Have your student close their eyes or face away. Make a sound with one object (ring a bell, crinkle paper, pour water). Ask: "What sound did you hear? Can you describe it?" (Loud or quiet? High or low? Fast or slow?)</p>
                    <p>Repeat with different sounds. After each sound, discuss: "How did you know what made that sound? What did your ears tell you?"</p>
                    <p>Then reverse: Let your student make sounds while you identify them. This shows that hearing works both ways for observation.</p>

                    <p>After they guess, pull the object out to check. Repeat with other objects. This shows how touch alone gives us information about things.</p>

                    <li>4-5 safe foods to taste: sweet (honey, apple), salty (pretzel, cracker), sour (lemon wedge, pickle), bitter (unsweetened cocoa powder—tiny amount)</li>
                    <li>4-5 safe items to smell: pleasant scents (orange peel, cinnamon, flowers, vanilla extract on cotton ball, mint leaves, coffee grounds)</li>
                    <li>Small cups of water for rinsing between tastes</li>
                    <li>Paper towels or napkins</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Taste foods</strong> → any safe foods with distinct flavors: banana (sweet), cheese (salty), orange (sour/sweet), plain yogurt (sour). Skip bitter if uncomfortable; young children may not like it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smell items</strong> → herbs from kitchen (basil, oregano), soap, shampoo, fresh bread, peanut butter, onion (cut), any distinctive safe scents</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety note:</strong> Always check for allergies before offering foods. Use very small amounts for tasting.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="lesson-procedure">
                <h3>Procedure</h3>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Say: "We've used our eyes, ears, and hands this week. Today we'll use two more senses—taste and smell!" Point to your tongue and nose.</p>
                    <p>Hold up an orange. Say: "Before I eat this orange, I can smell it." (Demonstrate smelling.) "When I eat it, I can taste it. These two senses help us learn about food and keep us safe."</p>
                    <p>Say: "Scientists use taste and smell to identify things. Let's try it!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Taste Exploration (4-5 minutes):</strong> Present 4 basic taste samples (sweet, salty, sour, and optionally bitter). Before each taste, ask your student to smell it first. Then give a small taste.</p>
                    <p>After tasting, ask: "How does it taste? Is it sweet, salty, or sour?" Introduce vocabulary: "Sweet tastes like honey or cookies. Salty tastes like chips. Sour tastes like lemons—it makes your face scrunch up!"</p>
                    <p>Have your student rinse with water between tastes. Discuss: "Your tongue has special parts that can taste different flavors. That's how you know if food is sweet or salty."</p>

                    <p><strong>Smell Exploration (4-5 minutes):</strong> Present 4-5 scent items. Have your student close their eyes and smell each one. Ask: "What do you smell? Can you describe it? Does it smell good or bad to you? Can you guess what it is?"</p>
                    <p>After smelling, reveal what each item is. Discuss: "Your nose can smell things even without touching or tasting them. Smell can tell you about things far away—like when someone is cooking!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Taste and Smell Connection Activity:</strong> Give your student a piece of apple. Have them smell it first, then taste it. Ask: "What did you notice when you smelled it? What did you taste?"</p>
                    <p>Then try this experiment: Have your student hold their nose closed while tasting something (like a small piece of apple or cheese). Ask: "Can you taste it as well when your nose is closed?" Release the nose. "Does it taste different now?"</p>
                    <p>Explain: "Taste and smell work together! When you smell food while eating, it makes the taste stronger. That's why when your nose is stuffy from a cold, food doesn't taste as good."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>

                    <p>Say: "Scientists use taste and smell to identify things, especially food. These senses can also keep us safe by telling us if food is good or bad."</p>

                    <p><strong>Five Senses Observation Challenge:</strong> Present a mystery object (for example, an orange). Say: "We're going to observe this object using all five senses. Let's start!"</p>

                    <p><strong>Sight:</strong> "What do you see? What color? What shape? What size? Any details?" (Orange, round, about this big, has bumpy skin with tiny dots.)</p>

                    <p><strong>Touch:</strong> "Now touch it carefully. How does it feel?" (Bumpy, rough skin, firm, cool, smooth on the outside.)</p>

                    <p><strong>Smell:</strong> "Smell it. What does it smell like?" (Sweet, fruity, citrus smell.)</p>

                    <p><strong>Hearing:</strong> "Can we hear anything? Let's tap it gently or shake it." (Makes a soft thud sound when tapped. Doesn't make noise when shaken—not hollow.)</p>

                    <p><strong>Taste (if edible and appropriate):</strong> Peel the orange and give your student a taste. "What does it taste like?" (Sweet, juicy, tangy, a little sour.)</p>

                <h3>Week 1 Complete!</h3>
                <p>This week, your student learned that scientists use all five senses to observe the world. They practiced using sight to see colors and shapes, hearing to identify sounds, touch to feel textures, taste to identify flavors, and smell to notice scents. They discovered that each sense provides different information and that using all five senses together helps us understand reality more completely. Next week, students will apply their observation skills to studying plants—learning to identify plant parts and discovering what plants need to grow!</p>
