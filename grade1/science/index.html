            <h2>Science Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In the first month of Grade 1 science, students become careful observers of the world around them.
                Through hands-on activities using materials from nature and home, students learn that science begins
                with looking closely at reality and asking questions. Each lesson emphasizes using their five senses
                to gather evidence, observing patterns, and drawing conclusions based on what they see, hear, touch,
                smell, and taste. Students discover that the natural world follows reliable patterns we can understand
                through observation and reason. From exploring their own senses to watching plants grow, observing
                animal behaviors, and tracking weather changes, students build the foundation for scientific thinking:
                careful observation leads to understanding reality.

                    <li>Use all five senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell) to observe and describe objects and experiences</li>
                    <li>Identify the parts of a plant (roots, stem, leaves, flowers) and describe what plants need to grow (water, sunlight, air)</li>
                    <li>Observe and describe characteristics of animals including body parts, movement, and basic needs (food, water, shelter)</li>

            <h2>Weekly Lesson Plans</h2>
            <p>Each week contains 5 daily lessons (Monday-Friday), each designed for 15-20 minutes of focused observation and hands-on exploration.</p>

            <div class="progression-overview">
                <!-- Week 1 -->
                <div class="week-card">
                    <h3>Week 1: Exploring with the Five Senses</h3>
                    <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will identify and use all five senses to observe and describe objects and experiences in their environment.</p>
                    <p class="week-summary">Students discover that science begins with observation using their five senses. Each day focuses on one sense (sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell), with activities that demonstrate how each sense provides different information about the world around us.</p>

                    <h3>Week 2: Observing Plants</h3>
                    <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will identify the parts of a plant and observe what plants need to grow and stay healthy.</p>
                    <p class="week-summary">Building on observation skills, students explore living things starting with plants. They learn to identify plant parts (roots, stem, leaves, flowers), observe plants in nature and at home, and discover through observation what plants need to survive.</p>

                    <p class="week-summary">Students turn their observation skills to animals—from pets to backyard wildlife. They learn to describe what they observe: body parts, how animals move, what they eat, and where they live. Activities emphasize that animals, like plants, have specific needs that must be met.</p>

                    <p class="week-summary">Students learn that science includes observing patterns over time. They track daily weather, observe clouds, measure temperature, and begin to understand seasons. Activities show that weather follows patterns we can observe, record, and predict.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started: Orientation for New Homeschool Teachers</h2>
            <p>If this is your first time teaching Science at home, here's how to prepare:</p>

            <div class="orientation-steps">
                <h3>Before You Begin</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Review the full week:</strong> Read through all 5 daily lessons before Monday. Science lessons emphasize observation, so you'll be guiding your student to look closely at the world.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gather materials:</strong> Most materials come from nature (leaves, rocks, flowers) or your home (food items, household objects). Check substitutions if you don't have specific items.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan outdoor time:</strong> Many lessons work best outside or near a window. Weather observation especially benefits from going outdoors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare your space:</strong> Set up a "science observation station"—a table or area where you can place objects to observe, with a magnifying glass if available (not required).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>During Each Lesson</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encourage observation:</strong> Ask "What do you notice?" and "What do you see?" Let your student describe what they observe before you explain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow the 4-part structure:</strong> Introduction → Main Activity → Practice → Closure. Science lessons emphasize hands-on observation time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the assessment questions:</strong> These help you verify your student is observing carefully and understanding concepts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Celebrate discoveries:</strong> When your student notices something new, celebrate their observation skills. Science is about curiosity and discovery.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Supplemental Resources (Optional)</h3>
                <p>Many lessons include optional YouTube videos about nature, library book suggestions about plants and animals, and Midjourney prompts for creating observation aids. These are enhancements, not requirements. Use them if they fit your family's schedule and resources.</p>
