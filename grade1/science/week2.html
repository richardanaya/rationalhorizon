            <h2>Week 2 Overview</h2>
            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will identify the parts of a plant and observe what plants need to grow and stay healthy.</p>
            <p>Building on last week's observation skills, students now explore living things—specifically plants. Through hands-on observation of real plants (from nature, houseplants, or the garden), students learn to identify the main parts of a plant: roots, stem, leaves, and flowers. They discover that each part has a specific job. Students also begin exploring what plants need to survive: water, sunlight, and air. By Friday, students understand that plants are living things with needs that must be met for them to grow and stay healthy.</p>

                <h4>Materials Substitutions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Whole plant</strong> → any plant with visible roots: dandelion pulled from yard, small weed, green onion from grocery store (with roots still attached), bean sprout, or small plant from garden center</li>
                    <li><strong>If no plant available</strong> → use pictures of plants from books or online, pointing to each part</li>
                    <li><strong>Drawing materials</strong> → can observe and describe verbally if paper not available</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="lesson-procedure">
                <h3>Procedure</h3>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Hold up a plant with roots visible. Say: "Last week we learned to observe with our five senses. This week we'll observe living things—plants! A plant is alive. It grows and changes."</p>
                    <p>Ask: "What parts of this plant do you see?" Let your student point and name any parts they know. Say: "Today we'll learn the names of the four main parts of a plant and what each part does."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Part 1: Identify Roots (2 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Point to the roots (the parts in the soil or at the bottom). Say: "These are the roots. Roots grow down into the soil. Roots have two important jobs: they hold the plant in place like an anchor, and they drink water from the soil."</p>
                    <p>Let your student gently touch the roots. Ask: "Do roots grow up or down?" (Down, into the ground.)</p>

                    <p><strong>Part 2: Identify Stem (2 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Point to the stem (the main stalk or trunk). Say: "This is the stem. The stem holds the plant up straight. It also carries water from the roots up to the leaves. The stem is like a straw that brings water to all parts of the plant."</p>
                    <p>Let your student touch the stem. Ask: "Does the stem feel soft or firm?" (Usually firm, to hold the plant up.)</p>

                    <p><strong>Part 3: Identify Leaves (2 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Point to the leaves (the green flat parts). Say: "These are the leaves. Leaves make food for the plant using sunlight. Leaves need light and air to do their job. Most leaves are green."</p>
                    <p>Let your student observe and feel a leaf. Ask: "What color are the leaves?" "How do they feel?"</p>

                    <p><strong>Part 4: Identify Flowers (2 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>If your plant has flowers, point to them. Say: "These are flowers. Flowers help the plant make seeds so new plants can grow. Not all plants have flowers all the time, but many plants grow them."</p>
                    <p>If no flower is present, say: "Our plant doesn't have flowers right now, but many plants grow colorful flowers during certain times of the year."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Draw and Label Activity:</strong> Give your student paper and crayons. Say: "Draw a plant and label the four parts: roots, stem, leaves, and flowers."</p>
                    <p>As they draw, review: "Where do the roots go? What color should the leaves be? Where is the stem?" Help them write the labels or write them as they point to each part.</p>
                    <p>Optional: Go outside and find real plants. Point to different parts and have your student identify them: "Show me the roots. Show me a leaf. Can you find a flower?"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Quiz: Point to each part and ask: "What is this part called? What does it do?"</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Roots: hold plant in place and drink water from soil</li>
                        <li>Stem: holds plant up and carries water to leaves</li>
                        <li>Leaves: make food using sunlight</li>
                        <li>Flowers: help plant make seeds for new plants</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Procedure</h3>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Review: "Yesterday we learned about plant parts. Who can tell me what roots do?" (Hold plant in ground, drink water.)</p>
                    <p>Say: "Today we'll see how roots work. We'll watch roots drink water—yes, plants drink just like we do!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Demonstration: Roots Absorb Water</strong></p>
                    <p>Fill a clear cup with water. Optional: Add a few drops of food coloring to make it easier to see.</p>
                    <p>Take a plant with visible roots (like a green onion or celery stalk) and place it in the water so the roots (or bottom cut end) are submerged.</p>
                    <p>Say: "Watch what happens over time. The roots will drink this water and pull it up into the plant. If we left this here for a few hours, we'd see the colored water move up into the stem and leaves."</p>
                    <p>Explain: "Roots have tiny holes that suck up water from the soil, just like you suck water through a straw. The water travels up through the stem to the leaves. This is how plants drink!"</p>

                    <p><strong>Activity: Testing Root Strength</strong></p>
                    <p>Go outside and find a small plant or weed growing in the ground. Have your student gently try to pull it up. Ask: "Is it easy or hard to pull?" (Usually hard—roots hold tight!)</p>
                    <p>Pull the plant up carefully so you can see the roots. Say: "Look how the roots spread out underground. They grip the soil so the plant doesn't blow away in the wind. Roots are like anchors for plants."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Observe the roots closely. Ask your student: "How many roots do you see? Are they thick or thin? Are they long or short? Do they have tiny branches?"</p>
                    <p>Say: "More roots mean the plant can drink more water and hold on tighter. Big trees have huge root systems that go deep underground."</p>
                    <p>Optional: Leave the plant in colored water for the rest of the day. Check back later to see if the color has moved up into the stem or leaves, showing that water traveled through the plant.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask: "What are the two jobs of roots?" (Anchor the plant in the ground; drink water from the soil.)</p>
                    <p>Ask: "What would happen to a plant if it had no roots?" (It would fall over and couldn't drink water, so it would die.)</p>

                    <p>Hold up a plant. Say: "The stem carries water from the roots to the leaves. And the leaves make food for the plant using sunlight. Let's see how!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Observing Stems (4 minutes):</strong></p>
                    <p>Look at different plant stems together. Some are thick (like tree branches), some are thin (like flower stems), some are green and bendable, some are woody and firm.</p>
                    <p>Ask: "Why do you think plants have stems?" Let your student think. Explain: "Stems have two jobs: First, they hold the plant up toward the sunlight. Second, they carry water from the roots to the leaves, like a pipeline."</p>
                    <p>Touch and feel different stems. Ask: "Is this stem soft or hard? Thin or thick? Green or brown?" Say: "Different plants have different stems, but they all do the same job—support and transport."</p>

                    <p><strong>Observing Leaves (4-6 minutes):</strong></p>
                    <p>Lay out several different leaves. Say: "Look at all these different leaves! They come in many shapes and sizes, but they all do the same important job."</p>
                    <p>Ask your student to observe the leaves: "What color are most leaves?" (Green.) "Why do you think leaves are green?" Explain: "Leaves have special green stuff called chlorophyll that helps them make food from sunlight."</p>
                    <p>Say: "Leaves take in sunlight, air, and water, and they make food for the plant. It's like the leaves are the plant's kitchen! This is how plants feed themselves."</p>
                    <p>Look closely at one leaf with your student. Point out: "See these lines? They're called veins. Veins carry water through the leaf, just like our veins carry blood through our body."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Leaf Observation Activity:</strong> Have your student choose 2-3 different leaves. For each leaf, observe and describe:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shape: Is it round, pointy, long and thin, wide?</li>
                        <li>Edge: Is the edge smooth or does it have teeth/bumps?</li>
                        <li>Texture: Is it smooth or rough? Shiny or dull?</li>
                        <li>Veins: Can you see the veins? How are they arranged?</li>
                        <li>Size: Is it big or small? Compare to your hand.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Have your student draw their favorite leaf and describe it: "This leaf is small and round with smooth edges and tiny veins."</p>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>

                    <p>Ask: "What do leaves do?" (Make food for the plant using sunlight.)</p>
                    <p>Say: "Stems and leaves work together to keep the plant healthy. Tomorrow we'll learn about what plants need to survive!"</p>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Say: "We've learned all about plant parts. Now let's discover what plants need to stay alive and healthy."</p>
                    <p>Ask: "What do YOU need to stay alive and grow?" (Food, water, air, shelter.) Say: "Plants are living things too, so they need certain things to survive. Can you guess what plants need?"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Plant Need #1: Water (2-3 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Show a healthy plant. Say: "Plants need water to live. Remember, roots drink water from the soil and send it to all parts of the plant."</p>
                    <p>Ask: "What would happen if we never gave this plant water?" Let your student think. Say: "Without water, the plant would dry up, wilt, turn brown, and die. Just like you get thirsty, plants need water to survive."</p>
                    <p>Water the plant together and say: "Now this plant can drink and stay healthy."</p>

                    <p><strong>Plant Need #2: Sunlight (3-4 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Place a plant in a sunny spot (by a window). Say: "Plants need sunlight. Remember how leaves make food? They need sunlight to do that. No sunlight means no food for the plant."</p>
                    <p>Ask: "What would happen if we put this plant in a dark closet with no light?" Let your student predict. Say: "Without light, the plant can't make food. It would become weak, turn yellow or pale, and eventually die."</p>
                    <p>Optional experiment: If you have two identical plants, put one in the sun and one in a dark closet. Say: "Let's check them in a few days to see what happens!"</p>

                    <p><strong>Plant Need #3: Air (2-3 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Say: "Plants also need air to breathe. You breathe in oxygen from the air, and plants breathe in carbon dioxide. They take it in through their leaves."</p>
                    <p>Say: "It's hard for us to take away air from a plant, but if a plant were in a sealed container with no fresh air, it would struggle to survive. Plants need air just like we do."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Observation and Prediction Activity:</strong> Look at plants in your home or go outside. Observe where plants are growing. Ask:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Is this plant in the sun or shade? Is it healthy or struggling?"</li>
                        <li>"Does this plant look like it has enough water? How can you tell?" (Green and strong = healthy; brown and wilted = needs water)</li>
                        <li>"Why do you think plants grow better by windows than in dark corners?"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Have your student draw a happy, healthy plant with labels showing: sun shining on it, water being poured on roots, and air around the leaves. Write: "Plants need water, sunlight, and air."</p>

                    <p>Ask: "What happens if a plant doesn't get water?" (It dries up and dies.) "What happens if a plant doesn't get sunlight?" (It can't make food and dies.)</p>
                    <p>Say: "Plants are living things with needs, just like animals. If we take care of plants and give them what they need, they grow big and strong!"</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Identify the Roots:</strong> "Where are the roots? What do they look like? Are they long or short? Thick or thin? What do the roots do for this plant?"</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Identify the Stem:</strong> "Where is the stem? Is it green or brown? Thick or thin? Soft or hard? What does the stem do?"</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Identify the Flower (if present):</strong> "Does this plant have a flower? What color is it? How many petals? What do flowers do for the plant?"</p>

                    <p><strong>5. Assess Plant Needs:</strong> "Is this plant healthy? Does it look like it's getting enough water? Where could we put it to get sunlight? How do we know it's getting air?"</p>

                <h3>Week 2 Complete!</h3>
                <p>This week, your student learned to observe plants as living things. They can now identify the four main parts of a plant—roots, stem, leaves, and flowers—and explain what each part does. They discovered that roots anchor plants and absorb water, stems provide support and transport water, leaves make food using sunlight, and flowers help create seeds. Most importantly, they learned that plants need three things to survive: water, sunlight, and air. Next week, students will observe animals, learning about animal body parts, behaviors, and needs!</p>
