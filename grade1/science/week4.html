            <h2>Week 4 Overview</h2>
            <p class="week-goal"><strong>Weekly Learning Goal:</strong> Students will observe daily weather patterns, describe weather conditions, and understand how weather changes over time.</p>
            <p>In this final week of the month, students apply their observation skills to understanding weather. Unlike plants and animals, weather is constantly changing, making it perfect for practicing ongoing observation. Students learn to describe different weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, windy, snowy), observe clouds, measure temperature, and understand that weather follows patterns we can track. By Friday, students understand that scientists observe weather to recognize patterns and make predictions. This week emphasizes that observation over time reveals patterns in nature.</p>

                <h3>Procedure</h3>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Say: "This week we're going to observe something that changes every day—the weather! Weather is what's happening in the sky and air around us right now."</p>
                    <p>Ask: "When you woke up this morning, was it sunny? Rainy? Cloudy?" Let your student describe what they noticed. Say: "Today we'll learn to observe and describe weather like scientists do."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>What Is Weather?</strong> Say: "Weather is the condition of the air outside. It includes things like: Is the sun shining? Are there clouds? Is it raining or snowing? Is it warm or cold? Is the wind blowing?"</p>

                    <p><strong>Five Common Weather Conditions:</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>1. Sunny:</strong> Show picture of sun. "When the sky is clear and the sun is bright, we say it's sunny. You can see your shadow on sunny days."</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Cloudy:</strong> Show picture of clouds. "When the sky is full of clouds and you can't see the sun clearly, it's cloudy. Clouds are made of tiny water droplets floating in the air."</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Rainy:</strong> Show picture of rain. "When water falls from the clouds, it's raining. Rain is important—it gives plants and animals water to drink."</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Snowy:</strong> Show picture of snow. "When it's very cold, water from clouds falls as snow instead of rain. Snow is frozen water crystals."</p>

                    <p><strong>5. Windy:</strong> Show picture of wind (tree bending, leaves blowing). "When the air is moving fast, we say it's windy. You can't see wind, but you can feel it and see it move things like leaves and clouds."</p>

                    <p><strong>Observe Today's Weather Together:</strong> Go to a window or step outside. Guide your student: "Look at the sky. What do you see? Is the sun out? Are there clouds? Is it raining or snowing? Do you feel wind?"</p>
                    <p>Help your student describe: "Today it is [sunny/cloudy/rainy/etc.]. The sky looks [clear/gray/blue]. I see [clouds/sun/rain]."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Draw Today's Weather:</strong> Have your student draw a picture of what the weather looks like right now. They should include: the sky, clouds (if any), sun (if visible), rain or snow (if happening), and anything else they observe (trees blowing in wind, puddles, etc.).</p>
                    <p>Below the drawing, help them write: "Today the weather is [describe]."</p>
                    <p><strong>Start a Weather Chart:</strong> Create a simple chart with days of the week. Have your student draw today's weather in today's box. Say: "Every day this week, we'll observe the weather and record what we see. By Friday, we'll see if the weather stayed the same or changed!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask: "What is weather?" (What's happening in the air and sky outside.) "Can you name three types of weather?" (Sunny, rainy, cloudy, snowy, windy.)</p>
                    <p>Ask: "What is today's weather?" Let your student describe using observation words.</p>
                    <p>Say: "Weather changes every day. Scientists observe weather every day to see patterns and make predictions."</p>
                    <p>Preview: "Tomorrow we'll look up at the sky and observe clouds more closely!"</p>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Review: "Yesterday we learned about weather. Today we're going to observe one part of weather more closely—clouds!"</p>
                    <p>Ask: "What are clouds?" Let your student guess. Say: "Clouds are made of tiny drops of water floating in the sky. They're so light they can float!"</p>
                    <p>Say: "Today we're going to be cloud watchers. We'll look up and observe what clouds look like."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Cloud Watching Activity:</strong> Go outside or look out a window at the sky. If possible, lie on a blanket and look up (this makes it easier and more fun!).</p>

                    <p><strong>Guided Observation Questions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Do you see clouds today? How many?" (Count together if not too many.)</li>
                        <li>"What color are the clouds?" (White, gray, sometimes dark gray or almost black before rain.)</li>
                        <li>"What shapes do you see? Do any clouds look like animals or objects?" (This is fun—clouds can look like all sorts of things!)</li>
                        <li>"Are the clouds moving? Watch for a minute. Do they change shape or position?" (Yes, wind pushes clouds across the sky.)</li>
                        <li>"Are the clouds big and puffy or thin and wispy or spread out across the whole sky?"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>What Clouds Tell Us:</strong> Explain: "Clouds give us clues about the weather."</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Puffy white clouds usually mean nice weather</li>
                        <li>Dark gray or black clouds often mean rain is coming</li>
                        <li>Clouds that cover the whole sky might bring rain or just a cloudy day</li>
                        <li>No clouds at all means clear, sunny weather</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Say: "Clouds are made of water. When clouds get heavy with water, the water falls as rain or snow. That's why dark clouds often mean rain is coming!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Draw the Clouds:</strong> Have your student draw what they observed. They should draw the sky and the clouds they saw. Encourage them to draw the shapes they noticed.</p>
                    <p>Ask them to label: "These are clouds. They look like [describe shape]. They are [color]. They are [moving/still]."</p>
                    <p><strong>Cloud Game:</strong> If time allows, play "What does that cloud look like?" Take turns pointing to clouds and saying what they remind you of. "That one looks like a bunny!" "That one looks like a boat!"</p>

                    <h4>Closure (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Ask: "What are clouds made of?" (Water.) "Do clouds stay in the same place?" (No, they move with the wind.)</p>
                    <p>Ask: "What do dark clouds often mean?" (Rain might be coming.)</p>
                    <p>Say: "Scientists observe clouds to help predict the weather. Clouds give us clues!"</p>

                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Say: "We've observed clouds and weather. Today we'll learn about temperature—how hot or cold it is outside—and how weather changes with the seasons."</p>
                    <p>Ask: "Does it feel hot or cold outside right now?" Let your student answer based on their experience. "How do you know?" (Feeling from going outside, what clothes you need to wear.)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Understanding Temperature:</strong></p>
                    <p>Say: "Temperature tells us how hot or cold the air is. When it's hot outside, we might feel sweaty and want cold water. When it's cold, we shiver and want a coat."</p>
                    <p>If you have a thermometer, show your student how it works. Say: "This tool measures temperature. Scientists use thermometers to record how hot or cold it is each day."</p>
                    <p>Check today's temperature together. Say: "Today it is [X] degrees. That means it's [hot/warm/cool/cold]."</p>

                    <p><strong>The Four Seasons:</strong> Explain: "Weather changes throughout the year in patterns called seasons. There are four seasons."</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Spring:</strong> "In spring, weather gets warmer after winter. Plants start growing. Flowers bloom. Rain is common. We might wear light jackets."</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Summer:</strong> "Summer is the hottest season. The sun is strong. Days are long. We wear shorts and t-shirts. It's a good time to swim!"</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Fall (Autumn):</strong> "In fall, weather gets cooler. Leaves change colors and fall from trees. We wear sweaters and long pants. Rain and wind are common."</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Winter:</strong> "Winter is the coldest season. In some places it snows. Days are short. We wear heavy coats, hats, and gloves to stay warm."</p>

                    <p>Ask: "What season is it right now?" Look outside together and observe: What does the weather feel like? What are the trees and plants doing? What clothes do you wear?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Draw the Seasons:</strong> Have your student divide their paper into four sections. In each section, draw one season with typical weather:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spring: Flowers, rain, mild weather</li>
                        <li>Summer: Bright sun, hot, shorts and t-shirts</li>
                        <li>Fall: Leaves changing colors, cooler weather, sweaters</li>
                        <li>Winter: Snow, cold, heavy coats</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Label each season and describe the weather: "Summer is hot and sunny."</p>

                    <p><strong>Seasons Matching Game:</strong> Show different clothing items or pictures. Ask: "Which season would you wear this?" (Coat = winter; shorts = summer; light jacket = spring/fall.)</p>

                    <p>Ask: "Which season is the hottest?" (Summer.) "Which is the coldest?" (Winter.)</p>

                    <h4>Introduction (2-3 minutes)</h4>
                    <p>Say: "Today we're going to observe two more parts of weather: wind and precipitation. Precipitation is a big word that means water falling from the sky—like rain or snow."</p>
                    <p>Ask: "Have you ever felt the wind blow? What does it feel like?" Let your student describe. "Can you see wind?" (No, but we can see what wind does—it moves things!)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Main Activity (8-10 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Part 1: Observing Wind (4-5 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Say: "Wind is air that is moving. We can't see air, but we can feel wind and see it move things around us."</p>

                    <p><strong>Wind Observation Activity:</strong> Go outside (or open a window safely). Guide your student:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Do you feel wind on your face? Is it strong or gentle?"</li>
                        <li>"Look at the trees. Are the branches and leaves moving? Moving leaves mean wind is blowing."</li>
                        <li>"Look at the clouds. Are they moving across the sky? Wind pushes clouds."</li>
                        <li>"Hold this tissue/paper/ribbon. What happens?" (Wind will blow it, make it wave or fly.)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Explain: "Wind can be gentle (a light breeze) or very strong (a big storm). Wind is caused by air moving from one place to another. Scientists measure wind to help predict weather."</p>

                    <p><strong>Part 2: Understanding Precipitation (4-5 minutes)</strong></p>
                    <p>Say: "Precipitation means water falling from clouds. There are four main types."</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Rain:</strong> "Rain is liquid water falling from clouds. Raindrops fall when clouds get too heavy with water."</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Snow:</strong> "When it's very cold, water in clouds freezes into snowflakes. Snowflakes are ice crystals that fall gently to the ground."</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Sleet:</strong> "Sleet is frozen rain. It's like tiny ice pellets that bounce when they hit the ground."</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Hail:</strong> "Hail is bigger chunks of ice that fall during storms. Hailstones can be as small as peas or as big as golf balls!"</p>

                    <p>Ask: "What type of precipitation is falling today?" Observe together. (If none, say: "Today there is no precipitation. The weather is dry.")</p>
                </div>

                <div class="procedure-part">
                    <h4>Practice (5-7 minutes)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Weather Observation:</strong> Have your student observe and record today's complete weather:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is it sunny, cloudy, or rainy?</li>
                        <li>What do the clouds look like (if any)?</li>
                        <li>Is it hot, warm, cool, or cold?</li>
                        <li>Is the wind blowing? Is it strong or gentle?</li>
                        <li>Is there precipitation? What type?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Have them draw today's weather showing all the elements they observe: sun or clouds, wind (show trees bending or leaves blowing), rain/snow (if present).</p>

                    <p><strong>Wind Experiment (if time):</strong> Test different objects in the wind. Which ones blow easily? Which are too heavy? (Feather blows easily; rock doesn't move.) Say: "Lighter objects are moved by wind more easily than heavy objects."</p>

                    <p>Ask: "What is precipitation?" (Water falling from clouds.) "Can you name two types?" (Rain, snow, sleet, hail.)</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Clouds:</strong> "Look at the sky. Are there clouds? What do they look like? What color are they? Are they moving?"</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Temperature:</strong> "How does the air feel? Is it hot, warm, cool, or cold? What clothes would you need to wear to be comfortable outside?" (Check thermometer if available.)</p>

                        <li>"Did the weather stay the same all week or did it change?"</li>
                        <li>"Which day was the sunniest? Which was the cloudiest?"</li>
                        <li>"Did it rain or snow this week?"</li>
                        <li>"What patterns did you notice?" (Weather changes day to day.)</li>

                    <p>Ask: "Why do scientists observe weather every day?" (To see patterns, to predict what weather is coming, to understand how weather changes.)</p>
                    <p>Say: "Weather is always changing. Now that you know how to observe it, you can be a weather watcher every day!"</p>
                    <p>Challenge: "This weekend, keep observing the weather. See if you can predict what tomorrow's weather will be based on today's clouds and wind!"</p>

                <h3>Week 4 Complete!</h3>
                <p>This week, your student learned to observe weather like a scientist. They can now identify and describe common weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, windy). They learned that clouds are made of water and give clues about upcoming weather. They understand temperature as how hot or cold it is and learned about the four seasons. They discovered that wind is moving air and precipitation is water falling from clouds (rain, snow, sleet, hail). Most importantly, they learned that weather changes over time and that scientists observe these changes to recognize patterns. Your student has completed the first month of Grade 1 science and is now a skilled observer of the natural world!</p>
