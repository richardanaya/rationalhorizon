            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reason as the Primary Tool:</strong> Students learn to think critically and logically</li>
                <li><strong>Reality-Based Learning:</strong> All knowledge is grounded in observable facts</li>
                <li><strong>Individual Achievement:</strong> Each child's unique potential is celebrated and developed</li>
                <li><strong>English Language Mastery:</strong> Deep focus on English grammar, vocabulary, and literature</li>
                <li><strong>American Heritage:</strong> Centered on United States history, geography, and civic principles</li>
                <li><strong>Integrated Knowledge:</strong> Subjects are connected to show the unity of human knowledge</li>
