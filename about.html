            <h2>A Father's Vision</h2>
            <p>
                Rational Horizon Academy was created by Richard Anaya, a father driven by 
                the desire to provide his daughter with an education that would cultivate 
                her capacity for independent thought and passionate pursuit of her own values. 
                Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, this curriculum was developed 
                to embody the philosophical principles he discovered through Ayn Rand's work.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This represents more than an educational program—it's a deeply personal 
                commitment to nurturing reason, individualism, and the pursuit of rational 
                happiness. Grounded in Objectivist principles, the curriculum aims to develop 
                young minds that think critically, value truth above conformity, and embrace 
                their unlimited potential.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
                We seek to provide children with the intellectual foundation they need to 
                become confident, rational individuals who understand their own worth and 
                capability. Every lesson is designed to instill the critical thinking skills 
                and philosophical clarity necessary for a lifetime of learning, achievement, 
                and genuine happiness.
            </p>
