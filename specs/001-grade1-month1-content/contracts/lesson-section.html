                 "Show your student a collection of colorful objects (blocks, crayons, toys). Ask: 'How many do you think we have?' Allow them to guess. Say: 'Today we're going to learn to count these objects from 1 to 10 to find out the exact number!'"

                  2. Student mirrors: Have your student point and count with you. Repeat 2-3 times.
                  3. Student independent count: Ask your student to count the objects alone while you observe.
                  4. Mix it up: Rearrange objects and count again. Explain that the order doesn't matter—there are still 10 objects.
                  5. Try different objects: Use coins, beans, or toys and count to 10 again."

<!-- NOTES FOR CONTENT CREATORS:

Week 1 Lessons (all 5 subjects):
- Use DETAILED procedure descriptions (see examples above)
- Include specific teacher scripts and student actions
- These serve as exemplars that teachers follow for Weeks 2-4

Weeks 2-4 Lessons:
- Use STRUCTURED TEMPLATES (see template format above)
- Provide clear guidance but allow teacher adaptation
- Teachers familiar with Week 1 format can fill in details

Content Guidelines:
- Keep language simple and directive (imperative mood for teachers)
- Use concrete examples, not abstract concepts
- Align with Objectivist principles: reality-based, reason-focused
- Materials: household items > purchased items > internet resources
- Time strictly 15-20 minutes for Grade 1 attention span
