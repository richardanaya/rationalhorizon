            <h2>Getting Started: Orientation for New Homeschool Teachers</h2>
            <p>If this is your first time teaching [SUBJECT_NAME] at home, here's how to prepare:</p>

            <div class="orientation-steps">
                <h3>Before You Begin</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Review the full week:</strong> Read through all 5 daily lessons before Monday to gather materials and familiarize yourself with the progression.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gather materials:</strong> Check the materials list for Week 1, Day 1. Most items are household objects—see substitutions if you don't have specific items.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan your schedule:</strong> Each lesson takes 15-20 minutes. Choose a consistent time each day when your student is alert and focused.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare your space:</strong> [SUBJECT-SPECIFIC SETUP - e.g., "Clear a table for math manipulatives" or "Have a comfortable reading corner"]</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>During Each Lesson</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start with the objective:</strong> Tell your student what they'll learn today in simple language.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow the 4-part structure:</strong> Introduction → Main Activity → Practice → Closure. Timing suggestions are flexible—adjust to your student's pace.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the assessment questions:</strong> These quick checks help you know if your student understood before moving forward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it positive:</strong> Focus on what your student CAN do. Learning happens through practice and encouragement.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Supplemental Resources (Optional)</h3>
                <p>Many lessons include optional YouTube videos, library book suggestions, and Midjourney image prompts. These are enhancements, not requirements. Use them if they fit your family's schedule and resources.</p>
